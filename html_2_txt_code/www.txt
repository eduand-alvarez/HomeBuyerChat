Real estate investment has long been a proven avenue for wealth creation, and with the proper knowledge and approach, it can offer tremendous opportunities for beginners. Whether considering your first investment property or seeking to expand your portfolio, understanding the essentials is crucial to successfully navigating the dynamic real estate market. In this article, we'll summarize the key insights from my blog post "10 Essential Tips for Beginner Real Estate Investors" to provide a concise overview of the fundamental principles you need to know.
1. Start with a Clear Investment Strategy:
Having a solid foundation is critical in any venture, and real estate investment is no exception. Define your investment goals, assess your risk tolerance, and develop a clear strategy that aligns with your objectives. Are you interested in residential or commercial properties? Long-term rentals or short-term flips? Having a well-defined plan will help guide your decisions and ensure you stay focused on your goals.
2. Research Local Real Estate Markets:
Real estate markets vary significantly from one location to another. Thoroughly researching local market trends, including property values, rental rates, and vacancy rates, is vital. By understanding the dynamics of your target market, you can identify areas with growth potential and make informed investment choices that maximize returns.
3. Analyze Investment Potential:
Conducting a comprehensive financial analysis is critical before making any real estate investment. Evaluate potential cash flow, return on investment (ROI), and other key financial metrics. This analysis should include property taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, and potential rental income. A detailed assessment will help determine whether a property is worthwhile.
4. Build a Reliable Network:
Networking is critical. You must build a network with real estate agents, property managers, lenders, and fellow investors. Attend industry events, join online communities, and engage in conversations to expand your network. Collaborating with experienced individuals can provide valuable insights, opportunities for partnerships, and access to off-market deals.
5. Secure Adequate Financing:
Understanding your financing options is crucial for successful real estate investing—research different financing avenues, such as traditional mortgages, 
private lenders
, or partnerships. Calculate your budget and assess your borrowing capacity to determine the most suitable financing method for your investment plans. Building a solid credit profile will also enhance your eligibility for favorable loan terms.
6. Perform Due Diligence:
Before finalizing any real estate transaction:
Perform thorough due diligence.
Conduct property inspections, review relevant documents, and verify all financial details.
Engage professionals such as real estate attorneys and inspectors to identify any potential risks or red flags.
Being diligent in your research will minimize unforeseen issues and protect your investment.
7. Mitigate Risk with Diversification:
Diversification is a prudent strategy for reducing risk in real estate investing. Instead of investing all your capital in a single property, consider spreading your investments across different property types, locations, or strategies. Diversification helps protect your portfolio against market volatility and potential losses.
8. Stay Informed and Adapt:
The real estate market is constantly changing. Stay informed about industry trends, regulatory changes, and economic factors that impact the market. Continuously educate yourself through books, podcasts, courses, and networking events. Being adaptable and proactive will help you make better decisions and take advantage of new opportunities.
9. Leverage Technology and Data:
Technology and data play a significant role in real estate investing in today's digital age. Utilize online platforms, data analytics, and real estate investment software to streamline your research, analysis, and property management processes. These tools can provide valuable insights, automate repetitive tasks, and improve efficiency in your investment operations.
10. Learn from Mistakes
Mistakes are inevitable in any learning process, and real estate investing is no exception. Embrace your mistakes as valuable lessons and opportunities for growth. Reflect on your experiences, analyze what went wrong, and adjust your strategies accordingly. Surround yourself with experienced mentors who can share their lessons learned, providing guidance and support along your investment journey.
Conclusion:
Real estate investment can be rewarding but requires careful planning, research, and adaptability. By following these ten essential tips, beginner real estate investors can lay a strong foundation for success. Remember to define your investment strategy, conduct thorough market research, analyze potential investments, build a reliable network, secure appropriate financing, perform due diligence, diversify your portfolio, stay informed, leverage technology and data, and learn from your mistakes. With these insights, you can confidently navigate the dynamic real estate market and unlock lucrative opportunities.

First-Time Home Buyers
Deciding to Buy a Home
Mortgages
It’s exciting — and a little scary — to think about buying your first home. Even when you know you’re 
ready to buy a house
, you might not be sure where to begin. These tips for first-time home buyers will help you navigate the process from start to finish.
Preparing to buy tips
1. Start saving early
When calculating 
how much money you need to buy a house
, consider one-time expenses as well as new, recurring bills. Here are the main upfront costs to consider when saving for a home:
Down payment:
 Your down payment requirement will depend on the type of mortgage you choose and the lender. Some conventional loans aimed at first-time home buyers with excellent credit require 
as little as 3% down
. But even a small down payment can be challenging to save. For example, a 3% down payment on a $300,000 home is $9,000. Use a 
down payment calculator
 to decide on a goal, and then set up automatic transfers from checking to savings to get started.
Closing costs:
 These are the fees and expenses you pay to finalize your mortgage, and they typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount. Your closing costs on a $300,000 loan could be between $6,000 and $18,000. That’s additional money you’d have to pay, on top of your down payment. In a buyer's market, you can often ask the seller to pay a portion of your 
closing costs
, and you can save on some expenses, such as home inspections, by shopping around.
Move-in expenses:
 Remember to budget for 
moving costs,
 which typically run up to $2,500 for most local moves. (Long-distance moves can be much pricier.) You'll need some cash after the home purchase. Set some money aside for immediate 
home repairs
, upgrades and furnishings.

2. Decide how much home you can afford
Figure out how much you can safely spend on a house before starting to shop. NerdWallet's 
home affordability calculator
 can help with setting a price range based on your income, debt, down payment, credit score and where you plan to live.

3. Check and polish your credit
Your credit score will determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and affect the interest rate lenders will offer. Having a higher score will generally get you a lower interest rate, so take these steps to polish your 
credit score to buy a house
:
Get free copies of your 
credit reports
 from each of the three credit bureaus — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — and dispute any errors that could hurt your score.
Pay all your bills on time, and keep credit card balances as low as possible.
Keep current credit cards open. Closing a card will increase the portion of available credit you use, which can lower your score.
Avoid opening new credit accounts while you’re applying for mortgages. Opening new accounts could put a hard inquiry on your credit report and lower the overall average age of your credit accounts, which could hurt your score. 
Track your credit score. NerdWallet offers a 
free credit score
 that updates weekly.
Mortgage selection tips
4. Explore mortgage options
A variety of mortgages are available with varying down payment and eligibility requirements. Here are the main categories:
Conventional mortgages
 are the most common type of home loan and are not guaranteed by the government. Some conventional loans targeted at first-time buyers require as little as 3% down.
FHA loans
 are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and allow down payments as low as 3.5%.
USDA loans
 are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They are for suburban and rural home buyers and usually require no down payment.
VA loans
 are guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They are for current military service members and veterans and usually require no down payment.
You also have options when it comes to the mortgage term. Most home buyers opt for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which is paid off in 30 years and has an interest rate that stays the same. A 15-year loan typically has a lower interest rate than a 30-year mortgage, but the monthly payments are larger.
» MORE:
Calculate a 15-year vs. 30-year mortgage
If you plan to stay in the home for only a few years, you might consider an 
adjustable-rate mortgage
, or ARM. ARMs often start with a lower fixed-interest introductory rate, enabling you to buy a more expensive home for the same monthly payment, but they can also increase (or decrease) over time.

5. Research first-time home buyer assistance programs
Many states and some cities and counties offer first-time home buyer programs, which often combine low-interest-rate loans with 
down payment assistance
 and closing cost assistance. If you meet low- to moderate-income benchmarks, you could qualify for a grant or forgivable loan that doesn’t need to be paid back.
Tax credits, known as mortgage credit certificates, are also available through some first-time home buyer programs.

6. Compare mortgage rates and fees
Plan to shop around for mortgage lenders and compare three to five different quotes. Doing so could save you thousands of dollars in interest over the lifetime of the loan. 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recommends requesting loan estimates for the same type of mortgage from multiple lenders to compare the costs, including interest rates and possible 
origination fees
.
Lenders may offer the opportunity to buy 
discount points
, which are fees the borrower pays upfront to lower the interest rate. Buying points can make sense if you have the money and plan to stay in the home for a long time. Use a 
discount points calculator
 to decide.
In a buyers market, some motivated sellers may offer to pay some or all of the buyer’s points to close the deal.
7. Gather your loan paperwork
Before you’re approved for a mortgage, your lender will ask you for financial records to verify your income, assets and debt, including:
Proof of income and employment, such as tax returns, W-2s and 1099s.
Statements for bank, retirement and brokerage accounts.
Records of debt payments, such as student loans, auto loans or any real estate debt.
Documentation of other events that impact your finances, such as divorce, bankruptcy or foreclosure.
Pull these documents ahead of time to stay organized throughout the process — you’ll need them for a mortgage preapproval as well as when you apply for the loan.
8. Get a preapproval letter
A 
mortgage preapproval
 is a lender's offer to loan you a certain amount under specific terms. Having a preapproval letter shows home sellers and real estate agents that you're a serious buyer and can give you an edge over home shoppers who haven’t taken this step yet.
Apply for preapproval when you're ready to start home shopping. A lender will pull your credit and review the documents you organized in the previous step. Applying for preapproval from more than one lender to shop rates shouldn't hurt your credit score as long as you apply for them within a limited time frame, such as 30 days.

Home shopping tips
9. Choose a real estate agent carefully
A good real estate agent will scour the market for homes that meet your needs and guide you through the negotiation and closing processes. Get agent referrals from other recent home buyers. Interview at least a few agents and request references. When speaking with potential agents, ask about their experience helping first-time home buyers in your market and how they plan to help you find a home. You might also ask how they find homes that aren't yet on the market, which can be a handy skill when buyer competition is fierce.

How to find a real estate agent
10. Narrow down your ideal type of house and neighborhood
Weigh the pros and cons of different types of homes, given your lifestyle and budget. 
An existing home generally costs less than 
buying a new construction home
. But if local inventory is low and you have the means, a brand-new home offers enticing options to customize.
A 
condominium
 or townhome may be more affordable than a 
single-family home
, but shared walls with neighbors will mean less privacy. Don't forget to budget for 
homeowners association
 fees when shopping for condos and townhomes, or houses in planned or gated communities.
A 
manufactured home
, including the type commonly called a mobile home, can be an affordable option if you have a tight budget. You’ll need to title it as real property and affix it to a permanent foundation if you want to finance it with a traditional mortgage. Many manufactured homes are financed through chattel loans, which have higher interest rates than mortgages.
Fixer-uppers
, or single-family homes in need of updates or repairs, usually sell for less per square foot than move-in-ready homes. However, you may need to budget extra for repairs and remodeling. 
Renovation mortgages
 finance both the home price and the cost of improvements in one loan.
» MORE:
Decide whether to buy, build or renovate
Think about your long-term needs and whether a 
starter home or forever home
 will meet them best. If you plan to start or expand your family, it may make sense to buy a home with extra room to grow.
Research potential neighborhoods thoroughly, including property values, 
property taxes
 and safety considerations. Choose one with amenities that are important to you, including schools and entertainment options. If you work away from home, test out the commute during rush hour.
» MORE:
How long does it take to buy a house?
11. Stick to your budget
To avoid financial stress down the road, set a price range based on your budget — and then stick to it.
A lender may offer to loan you more than what is comfortably affordable, or you may feel pressure to spend outside your comfort zone to beat another buyer’s offer in a 
bidding war.
In a competitive market, consider looking at properties below your price limit to give some wiggle room for bidding. In a buyers market, you may be able to view homes a bit above your limit. Your real estate agent can suggest a range for your offering price.

12. Make the most of walk-throughs and open houses
Online 
3D home tours
 have become more popular as technology improves. They don't supply all the information in-person visits do — like how the carpets smell — but they can help you narrow the list of properties to visit.
It’s possible to 
buy a house sight unseen
, but it’s always best to visit in person. Open your senses when walking through a  home. Listen for noise, pay attention to any odors and look at the overall condition of the home inside and out. Ask about the type and age of the electrical and plumbing systems and the 
roof
.

Home purchasing tips
13.  Don’t skip the home inspections
A 
home inspection
 is a thorough assessment of the structure and mechanical systems. Professional inspectors look for potential problems, so you can make an informed decision about buying the property. Here are some things to keep in mind:
Standard inspections don’t test for things like radon, mold or pests. Understand what's included in the inspection and ask your agent what other inspections you might need.
Make sure the inspectors can get to every part of the house, such as the roof and any crawl spaces.
The buyer doesn’t have to attend the inspection, but it could be useful to be there. By following the inspectors around you can get a better understanding of the home and ask questions on the spot. If you can't attend the inspections, review the reports carefully and ask about anything that's unclear.
» MORE:
Types of home inspections buyers should know
14. Negotiate with the seller
You may be able to save money by asking the seller to pay for repairs in advance or lower the price to cover the cost of repairs you’ll have to make later. You may also ask the seller to pay some of the closing costs. But keep in mind that lenders may limit the portion of closing costs the seller can pay.
Your negotiating power will depend on the local market. It's tougher to drive a hard bargain when there are more buyers than homes for sale. Work with your real estate agent to understand the local market and strategize accordingly.

Seller’s disclosure: What home sellers must reveal
15. Buy adequate home insurance
Your lender will require you to buy 
homeowners insurance
 before closing the deal. Home insurance covers the cost to repair or replace your home and belongings if they're damaged by an incident covered in the policy. It also provides liability insurance if you're held responsible for an injury or accident. Buy enough home insurance to cover the cost of rebuilding the home if it's destroyed.
It may be worth buying an 
umbrella policy
 if you need to cover your home, cars and other major assets.

1. Be Sure You’re Ready To Commit To A Loan 
One of the most important things for first-time home buyers to know is that they shouldn’t purchase a home prematurely. As a first-time home buyer, above all, be sure you’re ready to buy. Most mortgage loan terms are 
15 or 30 years
. Although you may not stay in your home for that long, buying a house is still a major commitment.
Start by asking yourself these questions:
Am I ready to commit to this home and city for at least 5 years?
Do I have an emergency fund that can cover at least 3 months of expenses?
Do I have a stable income?
If the answer to any of these questions is “no,” you may want to hold off on a home purchase for now. Consider whether you have any events on the horizon that could affect your location, income or expenses. If so, these are other reasons to pump the brakes.
2. Don’t Skip The Preapproval
It can be tempting to jump right into hunting for the perfect house, particularly if this is your first time – and especially if you’re in a rush to 
move out of your parents’ house
. However, it’s a good idea to get a mortgage preapproval before you begin comparing properties.
Knowing how 
prequalification differs from preapproval
 is also important. Let’s review that difference now.
Prequalification letter:
 A prequalification is an estimate of the amount of home loan you can get. It’s based on an informal evaluation of your income and other information.
Preapproval letter:
 A 
mortgage preapproval
 is an official document from a lender that tells you exactly how much loan money you can get based on your financial information, such as W-2s, bank statements and your credit score.
Benefits Of Preapproval
Benefits of getting preapproved include:
You know exactly how much home you can afford.
 You and your real estate agent know your home-purchasing power once you have a preapproval letter in hand. This will help you shop within your budget.
You can make a stronger offer.
 Sellers need to know that the buyer they choose can afford their home. A preapproval shows a seller you have the money needed to purchase the home.
You’ll experience fewer surprises.
 When you’re preapproved, you’re less likely to run into last-minute surprises or delays with your 
mortgage lender
.
3. Maintain Your Credit
Now isn’t the time to open a new line of credit, like a credit card or a personal loan. When you apply for mortgage preapproval, lenders will pull your credit report. Lenders may also monitor your credit report to see if you have new debt.
If they find that you’ve taken out another loan or line of credit, your credit balance has increased or you’ve started to make late payments, it could risk your final approval.
Be sure to keep paying your bills on time. Don’t attempt to influence your 
credit rating
 for better or worse or begin any risky spending. Lenders want to see that your behavior patterns are consistent and reliable for future payments.
4. Understand Your Loan Options
Did you know you can decide between multiple 
types of mortgage loans
? The type of loan you choose will influence your down payment amount, the type of home you can buy and more. Here are some of the more familiar mortgage loan types:
Conventional loans:
Conventional loans
 are the most common type of home loan. You can purchase a home with as little as 3% down in some cases.
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans:
 An 
FHA loan
 can allow you to buy a home with less strict financial and credit score requirements than a conventional loan. You can get an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment and a credit score as low as 580.
US Department of Agriculture (USDA) loans: 
USDA loans
 are for people who want to buy a home in a qualified rural or suburban area. You can get a USDA loan with 0% down, subject to household income restrictions. Rocket Mortgage® doesn’t offer USDA loans at this time.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans:
VA loans
 are exclusively for veterans, active-duty members of the armed forces and National Guard, and qualified spouses. You can buy a home with 0% down if you qualify for a VA loan.
Once you have a goal in mind, you can begin to set up automatic payments to your savings account, where you’ll likely save up for a down payment, making it easier to predict when you can make your move.
Get approved to buy a home.

With conventional loan down payments going as high as 20%, a down payment can be a big financial step for first-time homebuyers.
If you qualify as a first-time home buyer, you can benefit from several assistance programs that bring the range from 0% for VA loans to 3.5% for FHA loans. These programs provide 
down payment assistance
 loans and grants. However, if you have a down payment for at least 20% of the purchase price, you’ll be able to avoid 
private mortgage insurance (PMI)
 on a conventional loan.
One of the most important priorities of the FHA is helping home buyers with the purchase of their first home, and this includes assisting borrowers with their down payment. If you qualify as a first-time home buyer, you may have access to state programs, tax breaks and an FHA loan.
According to the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
, a first-time home buyer is any one of the following:
An individual who’s had no ownership in a principal residence during the 3-year period ending on the date of purchase (This includes a spouse, and if either spouse meets the aforementioned test, they’re considered a first-time home buyer.)
A single parent who’s only owned a principal residence with a former spouse while married
An individual who’s a displaced homemaker and has only owned a principal residence with a spouse
An individual who’s only owned a principal residence not permanently affixed to a permanent foundation in accordance with applicable regulations
An individual who’s only owned a property that wasn’t in compliance with state, local or model building codes and that can’t be brought into compliance for less than the cost of constructing a permanent structure
6. Don’t Forget Closing Costs
Don’t assume your down payment is all you’ll need to close on your mortgage loan. You’ll also need to cover 
closing costs
 before taking control of your property.
Closing costs are upfront expenses that go to your lender in exchange for arranging certain loan services. Common closing costs you might see include:
Attorney fees
Pest inspection
 fees
Appraisal fees
Escrow fees
Homeowners insurance
Title insurance
 expenses
Discount points
Property taxes
You’ll see your exact closing costs on a document called a 
Closing Disclosure
. Generally, you can expect to pay 2% – 5% of your total loan amount in closing costs.
As a first-time buyer, you may qualify for government-backed grants or loans that assist with closing costs. Additionally, it’s fairly common to ask the seller to help cover closing costs. 
Seller concessions
 could be a flat percentage of the total closing costs, or the seller could cover specific fees, like appraisal or attorney fees.
7. List Your Needs, Nonnegotiables And Nice-To-Haves
Your reason for buying a home will be your north star for making decisions about your purchase. If your goal is to dip your toe into 
real estate investment
, a duplex may be the perfect option for you.
If you’ve decided to move closer to older parents or a support system as you start a family, consider a 
condo
 or 
townhouse
 that’ll require less upkeep.
Once you’ve decided on the 
type of home
 that’s right for you, you can begin to prioritize which features you want in your home based on your needs.
For example, you might focus on finding a home with extra bedrooms if you plan to have children or need a home office. If pets are the light of your life, a big yard or a location near plenty of green spaces may be nonnegotiable.
Sit down and create a list of qualities you want and need in your new home. This will help you shop for homes more effectively and be less stressed when you 
compare properties
.
8. Work With A Real Estate Agent
Work with a 
real estate agent
 (who might also be a 
REALTOR®
) to find the perfect property. Agents and REALTORS® are local professionals who are experts in the home buying process and your local market.
A real estate professional can help by:
Showing you properties in your area that fit your needs and price range
Attending showings with you to learn more about your priorities as a homeowner
Helping you decide how much to offer for a property
Submitting an offer letter on your behalf
Helping you negotiate
 with the seller’s agent after you submit an offer
Attending the closing with you to make sure everything is in order with your sale
Remember that only a buyer’s agent will work on your behalf. Don’t rely on the seller’s agent to represent your best interests. Always choose a qualified real estate agent to help you buy a home.
Tested. Trusted. Top-rated.

9. Be Confident When You Submit An Offer
You should never 
submit an offer
 on a home unless you’re 100% committed to the purchase – or you could risk losing your 
earnest money deposit
, also known as a “good faith deposit.” Giving this money signals to the owner that you’re serious about the offer.
The deposit is typically equal to 1% – 3% of your total home price and goes toward your down payment. If you back out of the sale for a reason not listed in your offer letter, you’ll lose your earnest money deposit.
10. Hire An Inspector
You need to hire a professional inspector before getting a home. An inspection is different from the appraisal required by your lender. Here’s how:
The appraisal: 
During an 
appraisal
, your appraiser tells you and your lender how much your home is worth based on certain features of your home, market trends and recent sales of comparable properties (comps).
The inspection:
 During a 
home inspection
, the inspector tells you about specific problems with the property. You can use the results of your inspection to learn more about your home and request concessions from your seller.
An earnest money deposit letter often includes a 
home inspection contingency
, which can allow you to invalidate an offer and not lose your deposit if extensive repairs are needed.
11. Stick To Your Budget
Many first-time home buyers get emotionally invested in a house, but this can backfire if you can’t get the loan for the house or don’t have the funds to address major property issues that the inspection revealed.
Don’t go over your 
budget for a house
, even if the house seems perfect for you. Be sure to 
budget for repairs and renovations
. The right home is out there for you, so keep searching until you find a home that fits your budget and satisfies your list of must-haves.
12. Save Physical Copies Of Your Paperwork
Once you get moving on a house purchase, don’t forget about the paperwork. We recommend keeping a physical copy of your 
mortgage statements
, Closing Disclosure, 
deed
 and other related documents in a safe place.
Let anyone else named on your loan know where the documents are and how to access them in the event of an emergency.
13. Don’t Stop Learning
Investing in homeownership education can help you 
avoid making costly mistakes
, prioritize smart investments that offer reliable 
ROIs
, and build 
sweat equity
 in your first home.
Not sure where to start? Consider taking a 
first-time home buyers class
, which can help you:
Determine if you’re ready to be a homeowner
Budget and manage your finances
Calculate your home affordability
Compare mortgage types and lenders
Both in-person and online real estate courses are available. Some programs even offer financial perks, such as low down payments and closing-cost assistance.
        The Bottom Line: Plan Ahead When Buying A House For The First Time
Buying a home for the first time doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Wherever you land, it’s you and your loved ones who bring a home to life. Maintain your financial health so your quality of life increases, rather than decreases, with the purchase.
If you’re a first-time home buyer, 
explore your options
 with the experts at Rocket Mortgage. We’re here to help you every step of the way!

Last year may go down in real estate history as the year of correction. After a pandemic-fueled, seller-benefitting boom — with bidding wars, inventory shortages and spiraling prices all over the country — the housing market began to cool down in 2022. The

 and fast-rising interest rates dampened buyers’ interest, causing sales to slow and price appreciation to decelerate.
All this made 2023 something of a transitional year. And now, in 2024, inflation is much lower but home prices and mortgage rates are both still high. Sellers still have an edge in many areas, thanks to a continued scarcity of houses, and no one expects a dramatic 
housing market crash
. Still, many analysts see a shift coming toward a more balanced market, which would benefit buyers.
Whatever the economic state of the real estate market, buying a house can be an exciting and emotional process. Before starting your search, be sure you understand the ins and outs of homebuying, so you can make the best decisions for your family — and your wallet. Here’s what to know when buying a house, one step at a time.

Buying a house: A step-by-step guide
1. Determine why you want to buy a house
Purchasing a home is a major decision that shouldn’t be taken lightly. If you’re not clear on exactly what you want out of homeownership, you could end up regretting your choice.
Get started:
 Define your personal and financial goals. “Buyers should think about when they intend on moving and what they want in a home — amenities, ideal location and how long it could take them to save for a down payment,” says Edwence Georges, a real estate agent with RE/MAX in Westfield, New Jersey. “These are all important to help define the goals they would like to meet.”
Mortgage
Make a list of what’s important to you in a home. Is location the top priority? Any must-have amenities?
Analyze whether it makes sense for you financially. Would renting for another year or two improve your financial standing?
Be sure you’re prepared for the ongoing expenses of 
maintaining a home
.
2. Check your credit score
Your 
credit score
 will help you determine your financing options; lenders use it (among other factors) to set the terms and rates of your loan. The higher your score, the lower the interest rate you will be eligible for — lower scores equate to more expensive mortgages.
Get started:
 You can get your credit report and score from each of the three major credit reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, for free once a year. Your bank or credit card company might offer free access to your score or credit report, too. If you discover any discrepancies, contact each agency and report the error.
Mortgage
Consider how different credit score ranges impact your interest rate, monthly payments and total interest.
Pull your credit reports from each of the credit bureaus for free every 12 months at AnnualCreditReport.com.

.
3. Save for a down payment
To avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance, or PMI, you’ll need to put down at least 20 percent of the home’s purchase price for a down payment. Some lenders offer mortgages without PMI with lower down payments, but expect to pay a higher interest rate. Be sure to do your research: Many types of loans require a much 
lower minimum down payment
, and there are many government programs to help cover down payment costs for qualified buyers. Shop around carefully based on how much you’re able to pay upfront.
Get started:
 Research the requirements for the loan you want so you know exactly how much you’ll need to save for a down payment. If a friend, relative or employer has offered to provide a down payment gift, initiate a conversation early on to learn how much they plan to contribute and if there’s any shortfall you’ll need to cover — and secure a gift letter from them well in advance.
Mortgage
Consider options backed by the federal government. If you qualify for an FHA, VA or USDA loan, your down payment minimum will be considerably lower than 20 percent.
Conventional loans offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, meanwhile, require just 3 percent down.
Look into local and state 
down payment assistance programs
 to see if you’re eligible for a cost-saving loan or grant.
4. Create a housing budget
The purchase price and down payment aren’t the whole picture. Setting a realistic budget for your new home will help inform 
how much you can afford
 and what your all-in costs will be.
Get started:
 Carefully consider other expenses to determine what you can afford long-term. “Buyers tend to forget to factor in other costs, like homeowners association fees and maintenance,” says Paige Kruger, Realtor and founder of Signal Real Estate in Jacksonville Beach, Florida. “Just because you can afford a mortgage and a down payment doesn’t mean you can afford those long-term costs after you move.”
Mortgage
Figure out how much you can set aside for a down payment, plus a buffer fund for ongoing or unexpected maintenance costs.
Determine the maximum loan you qualify for. Getting preapproved can help (see Step 5).
Analyze your monthly budget to make sure you can handle mortgage payments along with your other day-to-day bills.
5. Shop for a mortgage
Getting 
preapproved for a mortgage
 gives you a firmer handle on how much you can afford, and it’s helpful when you make an offer on a house because it shows sellers you’re financially qualified. Once you’re ready to apply for official approval, you’re not obligated to stick with the same lender that issued your preapproval — compare the terms and rates offered by several companies.
Get started:
 Shop around with at least three lenders or a mortgage broker to increase your chances of getting a low interest rate. 
Sign up for a Bankrate account
 to determine the right time to strike on your mortgage with our daily rate trends.
Mortgage
Work with an experienced mortgage lender who can walk you through all the options and overall costs.
If you’re a first-time homebuyer, inquire about what programs or incentives might be available to you.
6. Hire a real estate agent
An experienced real estate agent can save you time and money by helping you find the right home and negotiating with the seller on your behalf. Agents are licensed professionals who know their markets well and can guide you through your homebuying journey.
Get started:
 Contact several local real estate agents and 
talk with them about your needs
 before choosing one. “Someone with knowledge of an area can tell if your budget is realistic or not, depending on the features you desire in a home,” Kruger says. “They can also point you to adjacent areas in your desired neighborhood or other types of considerations to help you find a house.”
Mortgage
Before hiring an agent, ask about their track record and knowledge of your desired neighborhood.
Inquire about their workload as well. You don’t want someone who is over-scheduled.
Bankrate can help 
match you with a qualified agent in your area
.
7. Go house-hunting
Viewing listing photos online is helpful, but isn’t a substitute for visiting homes in person and getting to know the area and its amenities. In some cases, 
the right neighborhood
 might be even more important than the home itself.
Get started:
 Be specific with your agent about exactly what kinds of homes you want to see, so they can more effectively find options that meet your criteria. And keep an open mind: You may not be able to check off everything on your wish list, so prioritize must-haves over things that are nice to have but not crucial.
Mortgage
Explore neighborhoods you like to see what’s for sale, and attend open houses for homes that pique your interest.
Take notes on each property you visit — after a few, they can start to blend together in your mind.
Keep your schedule open so you can pounce when a great home is listed, especially in a competitive market.
8. Make an offer
Understanding 
how to make an attractive offer on a home
 can help increase the chance of it being accepted, putting you one step closer to getting those coveted keys. Confer with your agent and let their expertise lead the way.
Get started:
 Once you find “the one,” your real estate agent will help you prepare a complete offer package, including your offer price, your preapproval letter, proof of funds for a down payment (this helps in competitive markets) and terms or contingencies.
Mortgage
Think carefully about what contingency clauses to include in your contract. 
Common real estate contingencies
 can hinge on financing, appraisal, home inspection and more.
It’s not unusual for sellers to make a counteroffer. You can respond if you wish to keep negotiating, or reject it and move on.
Once an offer is accepted, you’ll sign a purchase agreement and pay an earnest money deposit, typically 1 to 2 percent of the purchase price. The funds will be held in escrow until closing.
9. Get a home inspection
A home inspection provides an overall picture of the property’s condition and any mechanical or structural issues it might have. This will help you determine how to proceed with the closing process: If major problems are found, you might want to ask the seller for repairs — or, if there’s an inspection contingency in the contract, you might even decide to 
back out of the deal
.
Get started:
 Your agent can probably recommend a home inspector, but do your homework before choosing one. Depending on your contract and what state you’re in, you’ll generally need to complete the inspection within 10 to 14 days of signing a purchase agreement.
Mortgage
Check the inspector’s experience by reading online reviews, asking for client references and looking at their credentials.
To understand what is and isn’t covered, read Bankrate’s 
home inspection checklist
.
Fees can vary, but according to HomeAdvisor, you’ll likely pay somewhere between $281 and $403. The average is $342.
10. Negotiate repairs and credits
Your home inspection may reveal a few issues, especially if it’s an older home. Major problems might need to be dealt with before your mortgage lender will finalize your loan, and it’s common to negotiate for the seller to either pay for the repair or offer the buyer a credit to cover the cost.
Get started:
 Enlist your agent’s help with this — the need for repairs is not unusual, but negotiation can be delicate work and is best left to the pros. They will work with the seller’s agent to come to an agreement about repairs or credits.
Mortgage
Hazardous problems like structural damage or improper electrical wiring could keep your lender from approving your loan, so take the solutions very seriously.
Some sellers won’t agree to extensive repairs. That’s why a home inspection contingency is important — it gives you a way out of the deal if you need it.
11. Secure your financing
A preapproval is not the same thing as official approval. Getting final loan approval means you need to keep your finances and credit in line during the underwriting phase. Don’t open new credit lines or make any major purchases until the paperwork is signed, and avoid changing jobs before closing too, if possible.
Get started:
 Respond promptly to requests or questions from the lender, and double-check your loan estimate to ensure all the details are correct. You may need to submit additional paperwork as your lender completes the process, such as bank statements, tax returns or additional proof of income, so keep your paperwork organized.
Mortgage
Being preapproved doesn’t mean you’re in the clear — that’s not the case until a lender has given your loan the final stamp of approval.
Keep your finances and credit in good shape from preapproval until closing day.
Avoid running up credit cards, taking out new loans or closing credit accounts too. These things can hurt your credit score or impact your debt-to-income ratio, which can imperil your final loan approval.
12. Do a final walk-through
A 
final walk-through
 is your opportunity to view the property one last time before it becomes yours. This is your last chance to address any outstanding issues before the house becomes your responsibility.
Get started:
 Your agent will schedule the walk-through for shortly before closing. Bring your home inspection checklist and other documents, like repair invoices and receipts, to ensure everything was done as agreed and that the home is move-in ready.
Mortgage
Ask your agent to attend with you — they can act as a witness and help answer any questions.
If any problems remain, have your agent communicate immediately with the seller and your lender. Your closing date might have to be delayed to ensure those issues are remedied first.
13. Close on your house
Once all contingencies have been met, you’re happy with the final walk-through and your lender has declared your loan “clear to close,” it’s finally time to make it official and close on your new home. After all of the paperwork has been signed, the home is officially yours and you’ll get the keys. Congratulations!
Get started:
 Three business days before your closing date, the lender will provide you with a 
closing disclosure
 that outlines your loan details, such as the monthly payment, loan type and term, interest rate, loan fees and how much money you must bring to closing. You will attend the closing along with your real estate agent, possibly the seller and their agent, and the closing agent, who may be a representative from the escrow or title company or a real estate attorney. This is also when you’ll wire your closing costs and down payment, depending on the escrow company’s procedures.
Mortgage
When you get your closing disclosure, compare it to your loan estimate to ensure the terms are the same. Ask any questions and correct any errors before you sign the paperwork.
On closing day, review all the documents you sign carefully, and ask for clarification on anything you don’t understand.
Make sure you’re given all house keys, entry codes and garage door openers before leaving the closing.
Other things to consider
Is it the right time to buy?
Traditionally, spring is the start of the homebuying season, with many listings hitting the market and activity peaking over late spring/early summer. However, your own financial readiness is more important than the time of year.
Mortgage rates recently hit highs not seen in more than 20 years. Meanwhile, strong demand for homes has pushed prices higher and frustrated many potential homebuyers. This combination of high rates and high prices has plenty of people wondering whether they should try to 
buy a home now, or wait
 for things to settle down.
The answer likely depends on your own personal circumstances more than the condition of the housing market. If you’re financially stable, you have enough in savings to cover the down payment and other expenses, your employment and income are secure, and you’re ready to stay in one place for a while, then now is a perfectly fine time to buy a house. You can always refinance if rates drop significantly. On the other hand, if your savings are tight or your credit score is less than stellar, it might make more sense to take time to build those before buying.
One thing to keep in mind: Be sure to exercise caution anytime there’s a spike in home prices. “Be careful about buying near the top of the market, especially if you want to be in the home for only a few years,” says Ken H. Johnson, a real estate economist at Florida Atlantic University and co-author of the Beracha, Hardin & Johnson 
Buy vs. Rent Index
. If you’re looking to buy under these conditions, says Johnson, “bargain aggressively and be willing to walk away.”
What’s your local market like?
The area you’re house-hunting in has a major impact on what to brace for as a homebuyer. Each market has its own quirks to consider: For example, the taxes, 
cost of living
, job market and housing situation in California will yield different buying conditions than in Texas or Ohio. And even within the same city, real estate is very localized — you might be surprised by how drastically market conditions can vary from one neighborhood to the next. This is why partnering with a knowledgeable local agent who understands the intricacies of their market is so important.
How prepared are you for extra costs?
The down payment is often considered the biggest homebuying expense, since it’s a large amount that the buyer has to actually pay upfront. But homeownership involves plenty of additional costs that you should be ready for. Before you even close on the purchase, you’ll need to make sure you have enough money set aside to cover 
closing costs
. These fees will vary by state and by individual transaction, but they will almost certainly range into the thousands of dollars.
When budgeting for your monthly housing costs, factor in not only the principal and interest amounts of your mortgage payment, but also property taxes, home insurance premiums and homeowners association fees (if applicable), plus private mortgage insurance if you’re putting down less than 20 percent. And don’t forget to set aside money for ongoing maintenance and unexpected repairs, too.
FAQs
What is a good credit score to buy a house?
Caret Down
There is no hard and fast answer, but a credit score well into the 700s is a good place to start. The minimum score needed to qualify for most conventional loans is 620. But according to fourth quarter 2023 data from the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York
, the median score for mortgage originations is a high 770. The higher your credit score, the better rate you’re likely to qualify for.
Should I buy a house now or wait?
Caret Down
Mortgage rates and home prices are both running very high right now, and trying to time the market is risky. But the answer really comes down to your finances and life circumstances. If you’re stable and financially secure, buying now will let you begin building equity right away, and you can refinance down the line if rates decrease substantially. But if your savings could use more padding, your credit score needs time to rise or you don’t think you’ll be staying put for longer than a couple years, holding off may be a better move.
How much should I offer on a home?
Caret Down
There is no magic formula for an optimal home offer. Any offer will be heavily dependent on asking price and local market conditions, not to mention how much wiggle room you’re willing to leave for negotiations. Your real estate agent will know the local market well and can advise what a competitive — but fair — offer will look like in your area.

Deciding to Buy a Home
Mortgages
We’ve broken down the homebuying process into 15 main steps: Call it a buying-a-house checklist. Each step includes choices to make and things to do. Some are stressful, some are pretty cool and some are, well, kinda annoying. But each gets you one step closer to your goal of homeownership.
1. Make sure you're ready
Sure, there's being financially ready to buy a house (see Step 2 for that). But are you 
emotionally ready
? Even if it's just going to be your starter home, you're making a big financial commitment and putting down some roots.
You'll want to think about your other goals for the next few years. Are you buying with a partner, and if yes, are you on the same page when it comes to money? Is there any chance you'd need to relocate for work? Are you thinking of starting a family? These big-picture questions can add to the pros (or cons) of whether this is the 
right time to buy a house
.

 Back to top
2. Get your finances in order
Buying a house may be the biggest financial decision you'll ever make, so before you take the plunge you want to be sure your finances are solid.
Using a 
home affordability calculator
 can help you determine your budget by taking into account your income, debts, location and down payment amount (more on down payments in a moment). You'll be able to see how your monthly mortgage payments might add up and how your finances could look as a homeowner.
This can be important for keeping your ambitions down to earth. You might be able to qualify for a sizable mortgage, but that doesn't mean you actually want to commit that much of your budget to housing.
» MORE:
Calculate how much you might be able to borrow
Check your credit score, too. A higher credit score is the single most powerful way to earn a lower mortgage interest rate. Know the 
mortgage options for your credit score
. If your credit score could use some work, it may be worthwhile to hold off on homeownership and see what you can do to 
build up your score
.
 Back to top
3. Make a plan for the down payment
When you've determined what you can afford, you can figure out how much you want to save for a 
down payment
. Though 20% down payments used to be the norm, many homeowners opt to put down less. A smaller down payment requires less money upfront, but it means you'll have to pay 
mortgage insurance
, which typically increases your monthly payment. The type of home loan you use also impacts the minimum down payment required.
If this is your first home or if you haven't owned a house in a while, you may also want to look into 
state first-time home buyer programs
. Many offer financial help, including down payment assistance. And if you have a friend or family member who can afford it, you may also use 
gift money
 to increase your down payment. Rules about gift money vary by loan program.
🤓
Nerdy Tip
You'll want to set aside money for more than just the down payment. 
Closing costs
 generally run from 2% to 5% of the total cost of the loan. It's also a good idea to have some emergency funds in case the home needs unexpected repairs.

mortgage calculator

4. Create a wish list
See, told you there'd be some fun steps! And coming up with a list of must-haves and nice-to-haves for your house is definitely one of them. Whether you’re looking for a 
starter home 
or somewhere you can imagine living for years to come, there are lots of little details, but here are some of the bigger decisions you might make when drawing up your list:
Detached house or attached unit?
 If you're all about having a backyard, a traditional 
single-family home
 is for you. But if you're in a more heavily populated area or you don't want to deal with all that maintenance, 
buying a condo
 or 
townhouse
 might be your best bet. In some cities, 
co-ops
 are also an option. They can be less expensive than a condo, but a bit harder to finance.
» MORE:
 Pros and cons of buying a 
condo vs. a house
What's your ideal location?
 Assuming you're staying in state and know the general area where you want to live, now it's time to 
choose a neighborhood
. Think about factors like safety, amenities (like walkability, green spaces or coffee shops) and costs (which can include property taxes and, if it's part of a 
homeowner association
, HOA fees). It's also smart to consider the school district. Even if you don't plan to have children, school quality can impact the home's value — and help or hurt your resale price if and when you choose to sell.
» MORE:
What to look for when you're buying a house
Move-in ready or fixer-upper?
 It doesn't get easier than purchasing a house where all you need to do is move in. But if you're in a pricey or otherwise competitive market, taking on a property that needs TLC may help you afford a larger house or get into a costlier neighborhood. With a 
fixer-upper
, you will need to put in the work — and the cash — to make it livable, so make sure you're up to the challenge.

5. Find the right mortgage for you
The type of mortgage you use to buy a house affects what you'll need to qualify for the loan (including the required down payment amount) and how you'll pay it back. Choosing the right home loan can boost your chances of approval and may save you thousands in the long run.
Before you decide which type of mortgage to pursue, it’s important to learn the advantages and drawbacks of each one. Here are some of the main 
types of mortgages
:
Conventional loans
 are mortgages that are not guaranteed by the federal government. They offer low minimum down payments, but have more stringent qualifications.
FHA loans
 are mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration. These are generally easier to qualify for than conventional loans, but have stricter requirements for mortgage insurance.
VA loans
 from the Department of Veterans Affairs are for active or former service members and eligible spouses. VA purchase loans allow you to make no down payment.
Jumbo loans
 are mortgages for houses that are more expensive than standard lending limits. These usually require larger down payments and higher credit scores.
Renovation loans
 let you wrap the costs of home improvements into the total amount of the home loan. Especially when mortgage rates are low, this can be a way to borrow more money for repairs while paying less interest than you would with another type of home improvement loan, like a personal loan.

 choose the best mortgage
With each of these loan types, you may have the opportunity to choose between a 
fixed-rate
 or an 
adjustable-rate
 mortgage (also called an ARM). As you probably guessed from the names, fixed rates are static; adjustable rates can move up or down. An ARM loan can start at a lower interest rate than a fixed-rate loan, enabling you to buy more home for the same monthly payment — but rates can increase (or decrease) over time.
You'll also need to choose the mortgage term. 
Thirty-year mortgages
 are the most common, but 10-, 15- or 20-year terms may be available at a lower interest rate.
 Back to top
6. Get preapproved for a mortgage
You know your homebuying budget, and you've decided what type of home loan will work for you. Now it's time to start shopping for a 
mortgage lender
. There are lots of lenders out there, including big brick-and-mortar banks with familiar names, online-only nonbank lenders and smaller, local banks and credit unions that may offer more personalized service.
When you're looking at lenders, determining that they offer the type of loan you want is the first step. (If you've decided on an FHA loan and they aren't an FHA-approved lender, move on to the next one.) But beyond that basic hurdle, you'll want to look at how their sample rates compare with 
today's mortgage rates
, find out what 
closing costs
 you’ll be responsible for and compare
 mortgage origination fees
. You'll likely find some of this info right on their websites; to get some numbers, you'll have to speak with a loan officer.
Working with a lender to 
get preapproved
 for a mortgage is an important step in accurately determining your budget. A mortgage preapproval will give you real numbers, since the lender will have detailed info about your finances. That includes a 
hard inquiry
, which will show up on your credit report. The good news: If you apply with multiple lenders around the same time, it'll only count as one hard pull — and shopping around may help you find a lower rate.
» MORE:
What you'll need for a mortgage preapproval
Pulling together all the documents for a preapproval can be time-consuming. But once you have the documents for one lender, it's easier to apply with others, and what you'll get will be worth it. Along with the preapproval letter stating how much the lender is willing to lend you, you can also get a 
Loan Estimate
 form. This form isn't final, but it lets you easily compare lenders' rates, fees and other costs since they all use the same form. A preapproval letter is typically valid for only 60 to 90 days, after which it will need to be updated.
A preapproval letter also shows sellers and real estate agents that you're a serious buyer who can get financing, which can give you a crucial edge over competing home shoppers. You may also have heard of 
pre-qualification
, which traditionally gives you a rough estimate of what the lender might let you borrow based on self-reported data. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but a preapproval letter carries more weight — though neither preapproval nor pre-qualification is a guarantee that you'll close the loan.

7. Find a real estate agent
You've got your preapproval in hand and know what kind of house you're looking for, so let's find someone to help you look. The right 
real estate agent
 can make a huge difference throughout the process of buying a house, from knowing the ins and outs of the local market to providing moral support when the search feels endless to helping you negotiate with a seller.
It's a good idea to interview at least three agents. Ask people you know who've recently bought a home whether they'd recommend their agent. There's just one hard-and-fast “don't” here: Don't use the real estate agent who's selling the home you're hoping to buy. You want your own agent who will advocate and negotiate on your behalf.
The buyer's agent is generally paid a commission by the seller. However, you may sign a representation agreement with your real estate agent that may make you responsible for paying the commission if the seller doesn't. It's rare that the seller doesn't pay — it might come into play, for example, if you're buying a for-sale-by-owner property — but you should still read the agreement carefully and verify who'll pay in your case.

8. Go shopping!
Yes, this step merits an exclamation point — it's time to take scrolling through online real estate listings to the next level and actually see some homes in person. Make the most of your 
walk-through
, since you might only see a home once in person before you make an offer — especially in a 
hot market
. Try not to be thrown off by other home shoppers or by the seller's agent (who may or may not be in attendance).
Take photos with your phone to help jog your memory when you're deciding whether to make an offer. It might be easy to recall that charming breakfast nook or the extra bedroom that would make a perfect home office, but the aging appliances or decking that needs replacement could be out of sight, out of mind. Potential issues can affect the amount you offer or be things to bring up with a home inspector.

The case for the 'good enough' home
 Back to top
9. Make an offer
Found a home that's right for you? Now's the time to 
make an offer
. Your real estate agent can be a tremendous resource here, providing you with comparable sales information and any intel about the sellers they might have gleaned from the sellers' agent (like if they've already found a new place and are extra motivated to sell). You may also want help from a 
real estate attorney
. In some states, a lawyer is required to be part of any real estate transaction.
If the seller rejects your offer, you might make a counteroffer or walk away — it depends on why they turned you down. If the seller counters, talk it out with your agent to decide whether to accept or make your own counteroffer. It's during these negotiations that a buyer's agent really earns their keep.
Offer accepted? Congrats! Now you've got just a few more steps to go. You'll also likely write your first check at this point. 
Earnest money
 is a deposit you'll make toward the purchase of the house. It usually goes into an escrow account, and when the sale goes through, most buyers use it as part of their cash to close.

 Back to top
10. Get a mortgage
You know the property you want to buy and how much you'll have to pay for it. Now you'll choose a lender to 
get a mortgage
 from (you can go with a lender that preapproved you, or start fresh with a different one). Even with an online-first lender, you'll often work closely with a loan officer to complete the actual application.
This is a paperwork-heavy process, so get ready to do a lot of uploading. Here's what you're likely to need:
W-2 forms from the past two years (possibly more, if you've changed employers).
Pay stubs from the past 30 to 60 days.
Proof of other sources of income (including documentation of any gift money).
Federal income tax returns from the past two years.
Recent bank statements (usually for the last couple of months).
Details on long-term debts like car or student loans.
ID and Social Security number.
Once your mortgage application is complete, you'll go into 
underwriting
. During this process, the lender makes a final decision on whether to give you the loan — it's basically making sure there's not anything about the deal that's just too risky.
Underwriting includes digging deep into your finances, so you may need to come up with even more documents. The lender will also look at the home you've chosen via an appraisal (see Step 13 below) and request a 
title search
.
🤓
Nerdy Tip
Underwriting can feel tortuous — you're ready to close, so what is your lender doing? And during the pandemic, loans are taking longer to close. With many people buying and refinancing, lenders are dealing with a higher volume of loans. At the other end of the spectrum, they're also working with borrowers who are having difficulty paying their mortgages and need to apply for forbearance. Adhering to state guidelines may also mean that lenders are understaffed, as they may be limited to how many employees can be in offices.

 Back to top
11. Get homeowners insurance
It might feel a little strange to take out an insurance policy on a home you don't actually own yet, but most lenders make securing 
homeowners insurance
 a condition of giving you a mortgage. You'll want enough coverage to fully replace the home (which might not be the same as your purchase price or the appraised value), and typically the policy should become effective on your closing date.
» MORE:
See our picks for the best homeowners insurance companies
 Back to top
12. Schedule a home inspection
A basic 
home inspection
 can raise issues you might face down the road and point out any necessary repairs. This visual assessment covers all aspects of the house and its systems, from the foundation to the roof. If you have a particular concern, like mold or radon, you may want to get one of the more specialized 
types of home inspections
 in addition to a standard inspection. And if the home has features such as a pool, septic system or retaining walls, you may want to have these inspected as well.
You should choose the home inspector and pay for the home inspection. If it uncovers problems that weren't included in the seller's disclosures, you may be able to negotiate with the seller (see Step 14).
» MORE:
Is it OK to waive the home inspection?
 Back to top
13. Have the home appraised
The 
home appraisal
 is completely separate from the home inspection. While the home inspection is for your peace of mind, the appraisal is really for the lender, which doesn’t want to lend you more money than the home is actually worth. An appraisal looks closely at the home you're buying and at comparable recently sold homes to determine the market value of the property.
Your lender will choose the appraiser, but you'll pay for the appraisal. (Even if you're 
buying a house with cash
, you may want to consider hiring an appraiser yourself to be sure about your investment.)
 Back to top
14. Negotiate any repairs or credits with the seller
Though some items, like prorating property taxes or HOA fees, will already have been addressed in your offer letter, you may still have some items to negotiate before closing.
Your ability to negotiate can hinge on what kind of market you're facing. In a strong seller's market, it can be difficult to get concessions, since the seller can simply go to their next offer. But if it's an issue that will come up with any buyer — for example, a necessary repair that will get flagged by any home inspector — you may still have leverage. And in a buyer's market, almost any aspect of the transaction can be negotiated, including having the seller pay some of your closing costs or loan points.
🤓
Nerdy Tip
Asking for a credit at closing rather than for the seller to complete needed repairs can help keep the transaction moving. The seller simply rebates you an agreed-upon amount for specific improvements. That can save you a bit of cash at closing, plus handling the repairs yourself (whether DIY or with a pro) ensures the work will be done to your satisfaction.

 Back to top
15. Close on your new home
You've finally made it to the last step! Getting familiar with the standard closing documents ahead of time can make the 
closing process
 less nerve-wracking.
Your lender must provide you with the 
closing disclosure
 at least three days before the actual closing. You can compare it with your Loan Estimate to see whether and how any 
closing costs
 have changed. This will let you know how much total cash you’ll need to close.
On or close to closing day, you'll do a final walk-through with your real estate agent. You'll probably be buzzing with excitement, but make sure to check that everything’s as agreed upon (for example, that all the appliances that are supposed to be included in the sale are still there).
It's been a whirlwind of emotion and seemingly endless paperwork, not to mention that you may have just written the biggest check of your life — but now you're getting the keys to your new home. Congratulations, you did it!

                Tips for First-Time Home Buyers

Buying a house for the first time is super exciting. And wild. A home is the biggest purchase you’ll ever make!
If you’re still feeling some pressure in the market, that makes sense. Home prices aren’t going up like crazy like they were a year or two ago, but there’s still a lot of competition for nice homes. Not to mention, interest rates are about 2% higher than they were a year ago—and this can cut into your buying power.
You might be tempted to rush into a purchase before things get any crazier. But slow down! Trust me, you guys, it’s worth buying your first home the 
right
 way. That means finding one that works with your money goals—not against them.
You may be thinking, 
Yeah, that’s great, Rachel. But I don’t know how to buy a house for the first time. Where do I start?
I’m glad you asked! I put together a first-time home-buyers guide with 14 tips for future homeowners. Now, I know 14 tips sounds like a lot. But this is a big deal, and you want to do it right. Put these tips into practice so your first home is a blessing, not a burden.
              Key Takeaways
Your house payment should be no more than 25% of your take-home pay.
Steer clear of first-time home-buyer loans. A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is the best option.
Work with a trustworthy real estate agent who knows their stuff.
A Guide for First-Time Home Buyers: 14 Tips
Pay off all debt and build an emergency fund.
Use the 25% rule to see how much house you can afford.
Save a down payment.
Save for closing costs.
Avoid the worst mortgages for first-time home buyers.
Know the best mortgage for first-time home buyers.
Pick a lender you’re comfortable with.
Get preapproved for a loan before house hunting.
Find a trustworthy real estate agent.
Get clear on needs versus wants
.
Start looking for a house.
Make an offer on a house (within your budget).
Pay the deposit and start the mortgage process.
Close the deal.
Preparing to Buy Your First House
Before you can start looking for your dream home, you’ve got to do some legwork so you’re in a good position to buy. Let’s start right here.

1. Pay off all debt and build an emergency fund.
Okay, when you asked for first-time home-buyer tips, you probably didn’t expect to hear about paying off debt. But it’s hands down the most important.
Owning a home is much more expensive than renting, even if your monthly house payment will be less than your current rent. When you’re a homeowner, you’re responsible for covering 
everything
. And trust me, maintenance and mishaps add up fast!
Before you even think about buying your first home, keep renting so you can get 
debt-free
 and save an emergency fund
of 3–6 months of expenses. Then your money won’t be tied up in monthly payments and you’ll have cash to cover unexpected costs.
Avoiding Debt as a First-Time Home Buyer
Once you’re debt-free, I want you to stay that way. (Minus the mortgage. More on that in a minute.) So even though you’re excited about decorating your apartment, new furniture can wait.
See how much house you can afford with our free mortgage calculator!
I’m a spender, so I know that’s easier said than done. But it’s okay to let a room sit empty until you can afford to furnish it. Stick with the good money habits you learned while 
getting out of debt
. Your future self will thank you.
2. Use the 25% rule to figure out how much house you can afford.
Before house hunting, determine 
how much house you can afford
. Your monthly housing costs—including principal, interest, property taxes, home insurance, 
private mortgage insurance (PMI)
 and homeowners association (HOA) fees—should be 25% or less of your monthly take-home pay.
For example, if you bring home $6,600 a month, your maximum house payment is $1,650. Now imagine you get a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6% interest. If your property tax is 1.10%, HOA dues are $100, homeowners insurance is $1,500 per year, and PMI is 0.5% (for down payments below 20%), here are some home prices you could afford:
$152,000 home with 5% down ($7,600)
$160,000 home with 10% down ($16,000)
$185,000 home with 20% down ($37,000)
$209,000 home with 30% down ($62,700)
P.S. I got these estimates from Ramsey Solutions’ free 
mortgage calculator
. Try plugging in your own numbers to see other home prices that work with your budget.
3. Save a down payment.
The best down payment is an 
all-cash offer
. Nearly 1 in 4 buyers pay cash for their houses.
1
 But if that isn’t reasonable for your first house, aim for a 20% 
down payment
. That way, your lender won’t make you pay for PMI. PMI is insurance that protects your lender (not you) if you fail to make payments—so try to avoid this nonsense.
If 20% is still out of reach for you as a first-time home buyer, a smaller down payment of 5–10% is okay too.
After you’ve figured out your house budget by following the 25% rule, you really have to get serious about 
saving for a down payment
. The more you save, the more house you can afford. It’s hard work, but having a big down payment can be a game changer when you start shopping.
4. Save for closing costs.
It’s kind of a bummer, but you should plan to pay 3–4% of the cost of your home for buyer’s 
closing costs
.
2
 Some sellers might agree to pay part of of the buyer’s closing costs to sweeten the deal, but that’s not as common as it was years ago. 
Here’s an example of closing costs:
$300,000 home x 3% = $9,000 closing costs
That’s a big chunk of change—on top of your down payment—but I promise you can do it! Tackle these savings with intensity. You can even put retirement savings on hold for a short time to save for a home.
Buyer’s closing costs cover things like inspection and appraisal fees, loan origination and processing fees, property taxes, title insurance, and homeowners insurance. But don’t think sellers get off the hook, either. They have to pay a real estate agent commission (typically 6% of the sales price split between the listing agent and the buyer’s agent).
Choosing a Mortgage
You might be thinking, 
Wait, Rachel. I haven’t even found a home yet! 
But remember the old expression, “You snooze, you lose.” If you try to get a last-minute loan, you could miss out on your dream house. So it’s smart to line up your mortgage before you start house shopping.
5. Avoid the worst mortgages for first-time home buyers.
A huge benefit to being a first-time home buyer is that you’ve never fallen for an awful mortgage—and you don’t have to!
Many first-time home-buyer loans only make you put a little money down, but they cost tens of thousands of dollars more
in the long run. Don’t fall for it! Remember—if it seems like a good deal for you right now, then it’s an even better deal for your lender in the end.
Types of First-Time Home-Buyer Programs, Loans and Grants
Avoid these low-to-no down payment 
mortgage options
:
Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs):
ARMs sucker you in
 with a low initial interest rate. But then your lender raises your rate and your mortgage payment goes up. No, thanks!
Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans:
FHA loans
 are popular for first-time home buyers with not-so-great credit because you can put as little as 3.5% down. FHA loans seem great at first, but they have thousands of dollars of sneaky fees. They require you to pay a 1.75% mortgage insurance premium (MIP) up front and an annual premium between 0.15% and 0.75% often for the life of the loan.
3
Veterans Affairs (VA) loans:
VA loans
 let veterans buy homes with no down payment or PMI. But they usually charge high interest rates and include fees up to 3.3% of the purchase price.
4
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) loans:
 USDA loans are for people who live in rural areas. USDA loans don’t require a down payment, but they include additional premiums with an initial fee of 1% and a 0.35% annual fee.
5
Down Payment Assistance (DPA) loans:
 Some cities and states offer low- or no-interest loans to help people with lower incomes afford a down payment. Be careful though. DPA loans could get you stuck living in a home you can’t afford with little or no equity—which could be a big problem when you go to sell your house.
Since all of these first-time home-buyer programs have additional costs that don’t help you pay off your home, the best mortgage option for a first-time home buyer is a 
15-year fixed-rate conventional loan
.
6. Know the best mortgage for first-time home buyers.
I only recommend 15-year fixed-rate conventional mortgages. Here’s why:
Quicker payoff time: 
With 15-year loans, the monthly payments are higher than 30-year loans. 
But
 you’ll 
pay off your mortgage
 in half the time. Plus, most 15-year loans have a lower interest rate, saving you tons of money.
Locked-in interest rate: 
A fixed-rate loan
keeps your interest rate the same over the life of the loan so you pay less interest and always know what to expect.
Total Cost Breakdown
I’ve thrown around a lot of percentages and numbers. So, here’s a side-by-side comparison of the differences between a 15-year fixed-rate conventional loan and a 15-year FHA loan for a house priced at $300,000. To keep things simple, I left out property tax, homeowners insurance and HOA dues.
15-Year Fixed-Rate Loan for $300,000 House
FHA Loan
Conventional Loan
Down Payment
$10,500 (3.5%)
$60,000 (20%)
Base Loan Amount
$289,500
$240,000
Interest Rate
6.25%
6.25%
Monthly Payment
$2,576 (includes 0.4% MIP payment)
$2,058
Total Mortgage Insurance Premiums
$15,133 ($5,066 up-front MIP + $10,067 annual MIPs)
None (You don’t need private mortgage insurance if you put 20% down.)
Total Interest
$155,795
$130,407
Total Cost
$470,928
$430,407
A conventional loan with a 20% down payment could save you 
about $40,000 over the life of the loan!
 Plus, the payment on the conventional loan is $500 less—leaving you a lot more money in your budget for other expenses and financial goals.
How a 30-Year Mortgage Compares to a 15-Year
I’ll just say it: 30-year mortgages may have a lower monthly payment, but they cost more in the long run. Like tens of thousands of dollars more.
Imagine you want a $300,000 house with 20% down. You need a mortgage for $240,000. Even if the 30-year loan and the 15-year loan offered the same interest rate (unlikely, since 30-year rates are almost always higher), the 30-year mortgage still costs more.
15-Year at 6.25%
30-Year at 6.25%
Number of Payments
180
360
Monthly Payment
$2,558
$1,978
Total Interest Paid
$130,407
$291,981
Total Amount Paid
(including $60,000 down)
$430,407
$591,980
You’ll save $161,573 with a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage—and you’ll be payment-free 
15 years
 sooner. I mean, hello!
7. Pick a lender you’re comfortable with.
Some lenders care more about making a profit than helping people become a homeowner. When you’re starting to shop for your first house, talk to at least three lenders. Compare their interest rates, fees and customer service to find the best one for your finances and peace of mind.
If you’re debt-free, you need a lender who
doesn’t require a credit score. (Because you don’t have one anymore—yay!) So look for one who does manual underwriting, like 
Churchill Mortgage
.
8. Get preapproved for a loan 
before
 house hunting.
It pays to 
get 
preapproved
 for a loan (not just prequalified). Preapproval is when your lender verifies your financial information and gives you a letter saying how much money you can borrow.
Preapproval shows sellers you’re serious, and you can use your letter to get ahead in a competitive market.
Just know, some lenders may preapprove you for a bigger loan than you can afford. But you don’t have to borrow that much—or look at houses that are too expensive!
Looking for a House
Finally, we’re to the fun part! Follow these first-time home-buyer tips to start looking for your new house.
9. Find a trustworthy real estate agent.
One of the most important things you need to buy a house for the first time is a good real estate agent who will help you find the right home and navigate the buying process.
I always recommend working with a real estate agent. If you’re not sure where to start, connect with a 
RamseyTrusted agent
.
10. Get clear on needs versus wants.
Let’s be honest: Most of us aren’t very good at telling the difference between what we need and what we want. So, what can you do to change that?
Know what motivates you.
It’s easy to think you need a super nice house because your parents had one . . . but they worked for 30 years to get it. Or maybe you grew up in a less-than-perfect home, and you want a better one so you’ll feel like you’ve finally “made it.”
When we take time to learn 
why we spend money the way we do
, we can better understand what we need in a house—and what we can do without.
Be content.
When we compare ourselves and our stuff to others, we’re struggling with contentment. 
Contentment can make us rich
—and it can keep us from making bad money decisions. When you’re grateful for what you already have, it’ll put your house hunt into perspective.
Talk to people. 
Your real estate agent has helped dozens of first-time home buyers. They can help you figure out your needs and wants, set realistic expectations, and show you houses that check off the boxes on your wish list.
If you’re single, talk to a trusted friend who will point out your blind spots if you’re missing important details or dreaming a little too big. And if you’re married, now’s the time to get to know your spouse better! Be honest about what you both need and want in a home so you can find a place where you’ll both be happy. Consider things like neighborhood, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, school district, and lot size.
Be realistic.
As a first-time home buyer, you don’t have equity in an existing house, and you may not have a ton of savings either. A swimming pool and three-car garage probably won’t make the 
needs
 column for your first house. So you may have to make some sacrifices to stay within your budget. For instance, you may have to buy a house that needs fixing up or a smaller place where your kids share a room.
That’s okay. It’s tempting to think your first home is your forever home, but for most people, it isn’t. You need a house to fit this season of life—and you can always sell it and upgrade later. Keep your perspective and your cool.
Make a list.
Some things really may be nonnegotiable for you—whether they’re needs or wants. Maybe you need to live close enough to commute to work every day. Maybe your pets need a fence. Or maybe you want to live in a good school district for your kids.
List 3–5 things your house absolutely 
must 
have. (And yes, it’s okay to put a want or two on this list.) Then, write down the nice-to-haves that could be the cherry on top of your first home. And make sure to share your list with your real estate agent.
11. Start looking for a house.
Okay, you’ve got your shopping list in hand, and now it’s time to go house hunting. Here’s how it’s done.
Get ideas online.
Find homes you like online and send them to your real estate agent. Then, they can use the multiple listing service (MLS) to find more homes that check off the boxes for you.
Home buyers don’t have access to the MLS, but your real estate agent can use it to help you view the most properties for sale in your market. They can even help you find great deals on homes before they’re listed. It’s almost like shopping undercover, and I’m here for it.
Research neighborhoods for the best fit. 
Instead of running around the whole city looking for a house, narrow down your search to just a few areas. Remember, real estate prices are all about location, location, location. More desirable neighborhoods will have higher-priced homes, so don’t fall in love with a neighborhood you can’t afford. A good real estate agent can help you find the house and the neighborhood of your dreams.
Most home buyers would rather compromise on a home’s condition and size than on the quality of the neighborhood.
6
 Now, your real estate agent can’t talk about crime rates, schools or demographics. (That’s 
real estate steering
, and it’s illegal.) But they 
can 
tell you where to find that information for yourself.
You can also look up local schools and calculate your new commute times to see what they’re like. If you can, visit the neighborhood at different times to check traffic and noise levels and see if people are comfortable being outdoors.
Once you choose the neighborhoods you like, attend some open houses. Looking at homes for sale—even if they’re not perfect for you—helps you learn about the area.
Think long term.
Like I said, you probably won’t live in your first home forever, so don’t buy the most expensive house on the block. Future buyers who are shopping in a $200,000 neighborhood won't want a $300,000 home. But if you buy in the neighborhood’s low price range, you’ll have more room to 
build home value
.
Pay attention to what’s happening in the community too. Are home prices rising or falling? Are businesses booming or closing? You want a home that’ll be a good investment in the long run.
Be patient. 
Finding the right house takes time. More than likely, you’ll look at several houses. You may even make several offers before one gets accepted. And 
that’s just
 part of the process.
So keep dreaming about all the exciting possibilities that are open to you right now. Be patient and proud of the fact that you’re willing to wait for the 
right 
house—not settle for the wrong one.
Buying a House for the First Time
You finally found a home you love, and you’re ready to buy it. Congratulations! But you have a few more steps before you can call it home sweet home.
12. Make an offer on a house (within your budget).
It can be hard to know how much you should offer for your first house. That’s when you rely on your real estate agent’s expertise.
Ask them to help you make a competitive offer that’s within your budget and close to the home’s value. Don’t make an impulsive offer you can’t afford just to beat out the competition.
Stick to your budget.
If you set your budget at $350,000, I can almost guarantee a $400,000 
dream house
 will catch your eye. And then you’ll want to start fudging the numbers on your budget. Don’t give in to the temptation to buy a home you can’t afford!
If you buy that budget-busting dream home, it’ll become a nightmare. Your house payment will turn right into a source of constant stress, and every time the house needs some type of repair (and it will), you’ll feel like it’s the end of the world. This is called being house poor, and I don’t recommend it.
13. Pay the deposit and start the mortgage process.
After your offer is accepted, you’ll pay a type of deposit called 
earnest money
. Then, talk to your 
lender
 to get the ball rolling on approving your mortgage.
14. Close the deal.
Once the seller accepts your offer, you can 
close on the house
. The average closing process takes 43 days.
7
 During that time, your real estate agent will help you handle the remaining steps of buying the house, and they’ll let you know about any roadblocks.
Get a home inspection and appraisal.
Home inspectors can help you spot potential problems so you can fix them—or walk away from a bad deal! If you still want the house, the appraiser will assess its value. Then you can use the appraisal to try to negotiate a better price.  
Buy homeowners and title insurance.
Lenders require you to buy 
homeowners insurance
, which pays to repair or rebuild your house after a disaster.
Title insurance
 protects your home from claims against the property or questions of ownership—like the last owner’s unpaid tax bill or long-lost grandson who claims he inherited your house. It sounds crazy, but it happens. And it’s why title insurance is worth every penny!
Take out a mortgage.
Once you and the seller agree to move ahead with the deal, it’s time to return to the lender and get a mortgage. They’ll walk you through this process. But I can’t say it enough: Don’t let them talk you into borrowing more than you can afford! Stick to the 25% rule. Period.
Be patient as your lender finalizes your loan documents.
There’s a ton of paperwork that goes into getting a mortgage, and as you’re waiting for closing day, you’re going to get antsy to get into your new house. Try to be patient!
Do the final walk-through.
Right before you finally buy your first home, you’ll get to walk through it and make sure everything’s as it should be. This is also your last chance to back out of the deal if something’s wrong, so pay close attention here and be thorough.
Sign all the papers (but read them first).
Your hand is going to get tired from signing all your docs on closing day. It’s tempting to mentally check out and stop paying attention to what you’re signing, but you’re legally responsible for any papers you sign. Try to read every document carefully and ask your real estate agent to explain anything you don’t understand so you don’t end up in hot water. In other words, read the fine print!
Ready to Get Started?
Whew, you made it! We covered a lot of ground, but you probably still have some questions.  
That’s why you need a good real estate agent to guide you through the first-time home-buying process.

                Will Millennials Be Able to Buy a House?
Yes—and they do it all the time! Millennials actually made up the largest share of home buyers in 2022, according to a report by the National Association of REALTORS
®
.
5
 Sure, you might get sticker shock while house hunting, but 
buying a house as a millennial 
is
 possible
. 
You just need a good 
home budget
 to make sure you’re on track to save up a down payment.
                Can I use my 401(k) to buy a house?
You 
can
 withdraw money from your 
401(k) to buy a house
. But we’re not going to beat around the bush: Making an early withdrawal is a horrible idea. You’ll get hit with income taxes plus a 10% penalty. No thanks!
Hey, we know it’s tempting to tap into that pile of cash in your retirement account, but it’s not free money to spend however you want. Plus, you’ll derail your retirement savings—missing out on years and years of 
compound growth
.
                What Do I Need as a First-Time Home Buyer?
As a 
first-time home buyer
, you need to make sure you’re debt-free and have an emergency fund of 3–6 months of living expenses. That will set you up for success as you save money for a house and become a new homeowner.
                Are there first-time home-buyer benefits available?
Federal, state and local governments see the value of citizens being homeowners. And that’s why they’ve created benefits and programs like FHA loans and down-payment assistance to help you get a house.
But don’t let the government determine your future. Just because you qualify for a government-backed loan, that doesn’t mean you’re ready to buy a home. You have to make sure you’re on firm financial footing before you buy one.

10 Best-Kept Secrets for Buying a Home

Get the most out of your money with these handy home-buying tips from HGTV's Buying & Selling.
Buying Secret #10: Keep Your Money Where It Is
It’s not wise to make any huge purchases or move your money around three to six months before buying a new home. You don’t want to take any big chances with your credit profile. Lenders need to see that you’re reliable and they want a complete paper trail so that they can get you the best loan possible. If you open new credit cards, amass too much debt or buy a lot of big-ticket items, you’re going to have a hard time getting a loan.
Buying Secret #9: Get Pre-Approved for Your Home Loan
There’s a big difference between a buyer being pre-qualified and a buyer who has a pre-approved mortgage. Anybody can get pre-qualified for a loan. Getting pre-approved means a lender has looked at all of your financial information and they’ve let you know how much you can afford and how much they will lend you. Being pre-approved will save you a lot of time and energy so you are not running around looking at houses you can't afford. It also gives you the opportunity to shop around for the best deal and the best interest rates. Do your research: Learn about junk fees, processing fees or points and make sure there aren’t any hidden costs in the loan.
Buying Secret #8: Avoid a Border Dispute
It’s absolutely essential to get a survey done on your property so you know exactly what you’re buying. Knowing precisely where your property lines are may save you from a potential dispute with your neighbors. Also, your property tax is likely based on how much property you have, so it is best to have an accurate map drawn up.
Buying Secret # 7: Don’t Try to Time the Market
Don’t obsess with trying to time the market and figure out when is the best time to buy. Trying to anticipate the housing market is impossible. The best time to buy is when you find your perfect house and you can afford it. Real estate is cyclical, it goes up and it goes down and it goes back up again. So, if you try to wait for the perfect time, you’re probably going to miss out.
Buying Secret # 6: Bigger Isn’t Always Better
Everyone’s drawn to the biggest, most beautiful house on the block. But bigger is usually not better when it comes to houses. There’s an old adage in real estate that says don’t buy the biggest, best house on the block. The largest house only appeals to a very small audience and you never want to limit potential buyers when you go to re-sell. Your home is only going to go up in value as much as the other houses around you. If you pay $500,000 for a home and your neighbors pay $250,000 to $300,000, your appreciation is going to be limited. Sometimes it is best to is buy the worst house on the block, because the worst house per square foot always trades for more than the biggest house.
Buying Secret #5: Avoid Sleeper Costs
The difference between renting and homeownership is the sleeper costs. Most people just focus on their mortgage payment, but they also need to be aware of the other expenses such as property taxes, utilities and homeowner-association dues. New homeowners also need to be prepared to pay for repairs, maintenance and potential property-tax increases. Make sure you budget for sleeper costs so you’ll be covered and won’t risk losing your house.
Buying Secret #4: You’re Buying a House – Not Dating It
Buying a house based on emotions is just going to break your heart. If you fall in love with something, you might end up making some pretty bad financial decisions. There’s a big difference between your emotions and your instincts. Going with your instincts means that you recognize that you’re getting a great house for a good value. Going with your emotions is being obsessed with the paint color or the backyard. It’s an investment, so stay calm and be wise.
Buying Secret #3: Give Your House a Physical
Would you buy a car without checking under the hood? Of course you wouldn’t. 
Hire a home inspector
. It’ll cost about $200 but could end up saving you thousands. A home inspector’s sole responsibility is to provide you with information so that you can make a decision as to whether or not to buy. It’s really the only way to get an unbiased third-party opinion. If the inspector does find any issues with the home, you can use it as a bargaining tool for lowering the price of the home. It’s better to spend the money up front on an inspector than to find out later you have to spend a fortune.
Buying Secret #2: The Secret Science of Bidding
Your opening bid should be based on two things: what you can afford (because you don’t want to outbid yourself), and what you really believe the property is worth. Make your opening bid something that’s fair and reasonable and isn’t going to totally offend the seller. A lot of people think they should go lower the first time they make a bid. It all depends on what the market is doing at the time. You need to look at what other homes have gone for in that neighborhood and you want to get an average price per square foot. Sizing up a house on a price-per-square-foot basis is a great equalizer. Also, see if the neighbors have plans to put up a new addition or a basketball court or tennis court, something that might detract from the property’s value down the road.
Today, so many sellers are behind in their property taxes and if you have that valuable information it gives you a great card to negotiate a good deal. To find out, go to the county clerk’s office.
Sellers respect a bid that is an oddball number and are more likely to take it more seriously. A nice round number sounds like every other bid out there. When you get more specific the sellers will think you've given the offer careful thought.
Buying Secret #1: Stalk the Neighborhood
Before you buy, get the lay of the land – drop by morning noon and night. Many homebuyers have become completely distraught because they thought they found the perfect home, only to find out the neighborhood wasn’t for them. Drive by the house at all hours of the day to see what’s happening in the neighborhood. Do your regular commute from the house to make sure it is something you can deal with on a daily basis. Find out how far it is to the nearest grocery store and other services. Even if you don’t have kids, research the schools because it affects the value of your home in a very big way. If you buy a house in a good school district versus bad school district even in the same town, the value can be affected as much as 20 percent.

Investing in real estate
 can feel like walking a tightrope, especially for landlords with small to medium portfolios. The balancing act can be overwhelming between the highs of potential passive income and the lows of unexpected expenses, market swings, and tenant challenges.
But what if you had a safety net?
That’s exactly what this article aims to be: your safety net. Dive in as we guide you through 11 essential real estate investment tips, spanning from selecting the ideal property to managing it efficiently.
Top 11 Real Estate Investment Tips
Investing in rental properties can be an exciting adventure for a seasoned pro or a newbie. But before getting started, here are 11 real estate investing tips to be aware of.
1. Establish Your “Why”
If you’re considering dipping your toes into real estate investing, start with the big question: “Why?” This is especially important, considering real estate isn’t just about snagging a property and crossing your fingers for rent checks. This method of investing is an intricate dance of market trends, rules, and money moves. If you miss a beat, you might not get the returns you dreamed of.
To start off, consider whether your goals are more short-term, long-term, or a mixture of both. Do you want to make quick cash by flipping houses or craving a steady income from long-term rentals? Or maybe you’re eyeing early retirement, counting on real estate to diversify your investment mix.
If retiring early is your goal, a steady cash flow might be wisest. But if you’re all about big paydays, flipping properties can be a goldmine.
If you’re unsure on exactly what your “why” is or your goals, you can create a 
rental property business plan
. This will help you identify what your main goals are, what markets to enter, your financial plan, and overall strategy.
2. Find the Right Type of Investment Property
Rental properties aren’t one-size-fits-all. As a real estate investor, you’ll want to pinpoint the type of properties that syncs with your goals.
There are three main types of properties: single-family homes, multifamily buildings, and condominiums.
Single-family homes
: 
Single-family rentals
 tend to attract stable, long-term tenants, like families or roommates. They’re can be easier to manage due to less tenants, providing investors with a steady rental income. The downside? Relying on one tenant means vacancies can throw a wrench in your budget.
Multifamily buildings
: Think duplexes or apartment complexes. Here, it’s all about volume, with multiple rent payments coming in from one address. The downsides? Heftier upfront costs, slightly more demanding management, and the challenge of filling vacancies. But when the units are full, the returns you’ll get are huge.
Condominiums
: Condominiums, also referred to as 
condos
. often attract young, bustling professionals. They tend to be lower-maintenance than other properties thanks to homeowners associations (HOAs) covering their communal areas. The snag? HOA fees nibble at profits, and their rules are sometimes limiting for landlords.
In real estate investing, finding the property type that matches ‌your goals brings you closer to financial freedom.
3. Research the Location
Ever heard the mantra “location, location, location”? There’s a reason it’s so common. The right spot can drastically influence your property’s profitability.
Key factors to consider when it comes to location include the following:
Metrics:
 Start with hard numbers. Property values, rental yields, and occupancy rates provide a solid foundation. Are home values on the rise? That could hint at a neighborhood’s potential. High occupancy rates? A sign of demand. Dive into these metrics to forecast your investment’s potential.
Emerging neighborhoods
: You don’t always need prime spots. Emerging neighborhoods offer growth potential. Look for signs like new businesses, cultural hubs, or infrastructural developments. Investing early in these areas can mean higher returns as they gain popularity.
Crime rate
: Safety first! Before jumping in, get familiar with a location’s crime statistics. High crime rates not only deter tenants but can also impact property values and insurance costs. Use local police reports to get informed. You can also chat with locals to get the scoop.
Local amenities
: Local amenities can make or break the success of your rental property. Proximity to schools, healthcare, parks, and entertainment can be a big draw. Plus, check for public transport links. Ease of commute often tops renters’ priority lists.
A well-researched location can give you a competitive edge, as it helps ensure steady tenants, optimal rents, and long-term asset appreciation.
4. Make a Plan
Here’s how to lay out a clear path for your real estate investing journey:
1. 
Make a strategic plan:
 You now know your “why” and found the ideal investment property in the perfect location. Now, draft a clear strategy. Here are the components it should have:
Marketing:
 How will you promote your property? Think about online listings, professional photos, or even virtual tours to appeal to a broader audience.
Management:
 Decide upfront how hands-on you’ll be. Will you personally address tenants’ concerns or 
employ a property manager
? Also, consider how you’ll screen tenants and collect rent efficiently.
2. 
Make a financial plan:
 A solid financial blueprint is crucial. It’s not just about initial costs; it’s also about the ongoing ones that can catch you off-guard.
Your financial plan should consider the following:
Maintenance:
 Set aside funds to cover 
rental property maintenance costs
. Whether it’s a leaky roof or a creaky floorboard, maintenance is inevitable.
Insurance:
 Protecting your investment is non-negotiable. Factor in insurance costs to safeguard against unexpected events.
Mortgage and property taxes:
 These are ‌your most substantial recurring costs. Make sure they’re accounted for in your budget.
Improvements:
 Want to add value? Budget for improvements like kitchen upgrades or landscaping.
Unexpected costs:
 Always keep a rainy-day fund for unforeseen expenses, such as a malfunctioning water heater or a sudden tax hike.
Laying out a plan isn’t just about being organized; it’s about guaranteeing that your investment journey is smooth, predictable, and, ultimately, successful. So, grab that planner and start planning!
5. Buy Low
“Buy low, sell high” isn’t just stock market wisdom; it’s golden for the real estate industry, too. The benefits? It maximizes your return on investment and offers a buffer against market downturns. Image snagging an investment property at 20% below market value. Not only is this a steal, but it can also buffer you against unexpected market plunges.
But diving in without a strategy is risky. Here’s what you should watch out for:
Hidden costs:
 A‌ budget-friendly property might have hidden repair or maintenance expenses. Always invest in thorough inspections.
Location traps:
 Some properties are affordable because they’re in low-demand areas, making them challenging to rent out or resell. Make sure your location fits your long-term goals.
Legal hurdles:
 Unresolved legal tangles, from boundary disputes to cloudy titles, can turn a dream deal sour. Title checks are key.
Financial overreach:
 A low entry point might tempt you to over-extend financially. Make sure you’re sticking to your financial plan as you plan for needed renovations.
While buying low can set you on a path to substantial profits, it requires plenty of research and financial planning. But if it’s done right, it can position you for long-term success.
6. Stay Educated on Landlord-Tenant Laws
One thing that’s constant in real estate investing is change, especially regarding local regulations and taxes. Whether it’s local regulations evolving or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) adjusting its rules, like its 2022 change on reporting rental income over $600, awareness is crucial. To stay current with local laws, start with local government websites or 
state-specific educational resources
.
If keeping track of all this sounds overwhelming, consider connecting with a real estate attorney. Their know-how can be a great safety net.
7. Understand the Risk Factors of Managing Tenants
Not every tenant is going to be a dream to work with. When diving into the landlord game, expect the unexpected. From tenants breaking lease agreements early to not respecting property rules, unpredictable behaviors can throw off even the best-laid plans.
But it’s not just about handling tenant relations. As a landlord, there are also financial surprises that can disrupt your cash flow. Here’s where a rainy-day fund comes into play. You’ll thank yourself later for keeping this fund available.
Remember, risk is part of the property management game. Embrace it and seek out 
resources
 to help you along the way.
8. Build a Network
The importance of networking cannot be overstated. With the right contacts, you’ve got a quick fix on speed dial for a broken pipe at midnight.
Strategies to build your network include the following:
Chat with fellow landlords:
Connecting with other landlords
 creates a goldmine of contacts. They’ve walked this path and often have a handy list of pros.
Dive into online reviews:
 A quick scroll through reviews can be the difference between hiring a star and a dud.
Connect with real estate agents:
 Ever met someone who knows everyone? That’s your local real estate agent. They’ve got the inside scoop on who’s best in town.
And while you’re making friends, why not partner with local businesses? Maybe it’s a deal with a café down the street or a discount at a nearby gym. Your tenants will love those extra perks.
9. Stay on Top of Maintenance
Ever dealt with a leaky roof or a busted pipe? Even seemingly minor neglect can snowball into pricey repairs.
Here’s a practical tip for newbie landlords: pencil in seasonal property check-ups. 
Fall
 can be ideal for gutter cleaning to prevent ice dams, while spring might be your go-to for HVAC checks before the summer heatwave hits. And don’t forget those fire alarms! Regular battery checks can be the difference between a safe home and a potential hazard.
This proactive approach not only preserves your property’s value but also cements your reputation as a trustworthy landlord. Remember, satisfied tenants often mean longer leases, and a well-maintained property is always appealing.
10. Diversify
Dipping your toe into the real estate pool is exciting. But avoid tying your entire fortune to a single property or area. Let’s say you’ve invested in a suburban family home. Why not consider an urban studio next? Or maybe even a commercial space, like a charming cafe spot downtown? Some landlords explore 
Real Estate Investment Trusts
 (REITs), which allow you to invest in real estate without buying more physical property.
Diversifying lets you capture varied tenant demographics while creating a cushion against market downturns.
11. Explore Money and Time-Saving Options
Stepping into the landlord world can be overwhelming, but finding efficiency is paramount.
One way to do this is by leveraging 
property management software platforms
. Handling online rent collection with the right platform can encourage on-time payments, reduce the need for those uncomfortable rent-chasing conversations. Landlord platforms have reinvented tenant screening, making it a breeze.
And forget about that repair request buried in a sea of emails. Maintenance management tools keep you organized. Toss in a virtual tour to offer potential tenants a convenient, 24/7 look at your property—and hopefully, speed up the leasing process.
Various options exist, all of which differ in pricing and overall features. Avail is one example of landlord software that can help you streamline the property management process without a property manager. You can also track rental property accounting to ensure you’re prepared for tax season.
Reap the Rewards of Your Real Estate Investment
Becoming a real estate investor can feel daunting, but you’re not stepping into the unknown. With these strategic tips in hand, your path becomes clearer and more navigable.
And for that extra layer of assurance? Let Avail join your journey. From precise tenant screening to seamless maintenance coordination, Avail is the partner every new investor wishes for.

23 Smart Real Estate Investing Tips from Successful Investors
Written by
 Blair Franklin
Last updated on October 29, 2021
Real estate investing doesn’t come with a map, and the road to riches is often winding. That being said, there are things you can do to put yourself on the right path and ensure your best chances for success. 
Listening to real estate professionals and successful investors is a great place to start. 
To get you in the mindset of the pros, we gathered 23 essential 
real estate investing
 tips from people who can speak from experience. 
Whether you're new to real estate investing or going on your third income property, this article is filled with great nuggets of advice and interesting perspectives. Dive in.
1. Find rental properties in emerging neighborhoods
“Rental properties represent a great way to get involved with real estate investments. Emerging neighborhoods offer growth potential and tax incentives for buyers. Buyers that purchase properties in emerging neighborhoods maximize profits and ensure that their income covers their costs.”
-Ralph DiBugnara, President of 
Home Qualified
2. Diversify your investments
“It's commonly preached that the best real estate investment is the one in your backyard. While there is merit to understanding the area in which you're investing, I believe that you're truly limiting your profitability potential by only considering a small geographic area.
By 
considering investments in other states and cities
 you'll have a large pool of available investments and ultimately better opportunities. Investing across a large geographical area also further diversifies your investments and protects your portfolio against the volatility of local markets."
-Jeff Miller, real estate investor and co-founder of 
AE Home Group
 in Maryland

3. Don’t over-rehab
Corey Chappell, a Closing Options Analyst at 
181 Close Now
 offers some great property investment tips (which we’ve included in the next several points). He starts by explaining that investment properties don't need to be on par with Pottery Barn when it comes to accents and fixtures.
“Some high-end houses have to have the nicest countertops and fixtures. Lower-end houses need to look nice and modern but don’t need the most expensive everything. It’s OK to budget. It’s OK to go with the middle-of-the road fixtures.”
-Corey Chappell, Closing Options Analyst at 
181 Close Now

4. Don’t over-leverage yourself
“You can be very successful for a long time and still go broke if every rental is mortgages to the hilt. If you keep some of your rentals free and clear and some of them financed then you’ll have a good mix of safety and still stretching your resources.
Do it right, and a few longer-than-expected vacancies or dips in your cash flow doesn’t have to be the end of your career.” 
-Corey Chappell, Closing Options Analyst at 
181 Close Now
5. Look into single-family rentals
“
Single family homes
are your safest bet for attracting the correct tenant. Everyone would love to live in a house. Some people just cannot afford to, or do not want to own. The single family home historically has over the last hundred plus years always appreciated.”
-Don Wede, President of
Heartland Funding Inc
.

6. Do your homework before listening to paid advisors 
“In many cases, your trusted and paid advisors (broker, wealth manager, tax accountant, etc.) may suggest you avoid real estate in your portfolio altogether. They generally give the same tired reasons that it’s ‘illiquid’ or ‘too management-intensive.’ Those can be valid arguments based on your specific situation, but that’s not the real reason they want you to avoid real estate.
Stockbrokers don’t get paid for you to invest in real estate. There’s nothing in it for them, no commissions and nothing to do. That is, unless they want you to purchase a high-cost, non-traded REIT, but now you’ll know their true motivation. You need to do your own homework to decide if the potential cash flow from real estate is right for you.”
-David B. Saxe, 
Calvera Partners, LLC
7. Nip maintenance issues in the bud before they get bigger
"One thing that's helped me quite a bit is writing a bi-annual walkthrough into the lease agreements. This is mainly to ask the renter if there's anything they're noticing that needs to get fixed.
We'd also inspect under all the sinks and around the toilets, etc. for water damage. Finding small water leaks before they become big problems has saved me a lot of money."
-Suresh Srinivasan, Chief Marketing Officer, 
Roofstock
8. Join a local networking group
“There are literally thousands of REI (real estate investing) groups all across the country. Join one or two. Participate in a few. Find the ones that have the people and topics that you are interested in. 
Try to find groups that don't ‘pitch’ products but really educate and mentor you in the areas that pique your interest.”
-Keith Jenkins, 
Nationwide Real Estate Investment Clubs
9. Leverage the experts
“Investing in real estate has a lot of moving pieces. When you're first starting off it is critical that you leverage experts in each area of the project to ensure success and minimize mistakes.
Services like 
Roofstock
 are a great option for investors since they're a team of experts who have already conducted the due diligence on your behalf. I find that by keeping things simple, less mistakes are made and you become more profitable in the long run. There's no point in reinventing the wheel when there is already a proven process available to you.”
-Evan Roberts, real estate agent and investor with 
Dependable Homebuyers
 in Baltimore, MD
10. Get to know your market
“When investing in real estate, it is important to learn about and become an expert in your selected 
market
. Being well informed on the current trends, including any decreases or increases in the average rent, income, interest rates, and even unemployment/crime rates will allow you to recognize the current market status and plan for the future.
Being able to constantly forecast and stay a step ahead of the market can help lead you to become a more effective real estate investor.”
-Sacha Ferrandi, Founder & Head Principal, 
Source Capital Funding, Inc.
 and 
Texas Hard Money

11. Understand crime rates
“Research the area's crime rates. We failed to do this when we bought our first property. We had the hardest time finding new tenants when the first set of tenants moved out three years ago.
Out of desperation, I advertised a move-in bonus after six months of vacancy. I even reached out to numerous affordable housing programs and nonprofits in the area to see if they had interested clients. After speaking with some people and doing online research about the area, I learned that it had the highest homicide rate in Los Angeles County... no wonder no one wanted to live there!”
-
Ky Trang Ho
, Key Financial Media LLC
12. Set a budget and timeline (and expect to go over both)
“My rule of thumb is that you should set aside 50% more of your budget as reserves, especially as a new investor. Your budget almost always goes higher than anticipated and when you're rehabbing houses, one issue can detect another one, etc.
For example, fixing a leaky pipe may turn into replacing the pipe and removing mold damage and replacing the drywall. In terms of timeline, I would say that the same thing goes: If your timeline is 60 days, prepare for the project to take 90 days. With added expenses, comes added time.”
-Allison Bethell, 
Fit Small Business
13. Have a rainy day fund
“When buying rental houses for cash flow, make sure you account for all of the expenses and have rainy day funds set aside for future expenses. For the last decade of owning rental properties, our annual expenses (excluding debt servicing costs) have averaged between 45-55% (depending on the year) of the gross rent. These are for properties that rent between $800-1,000 per month.
If you are renting out higher-end properties, your ratios may be different, but for most markets, your ratios will be very similar to these. Make sure you keep a reserve in place to cover unforeseen expenses, because you never know when they will hit.”
-Brady Hanna, President of 
Mill Creek Home Buyers
14. Treat your investments like a business
"Real estate investing is a business and like every other business it requires purposeful planning, execution, and management. The most successful businesses are run by high quality people at every level of the organization.
Those that ignore this fact are destined to struggle or even fail. Regardless of how big or small you want your to grow your real estate investing business, if you want to succeed then you must run it like a business."
-Chris Counds, 
Texas Ideal Properties
15. If you can’t beat the price, beat the terms
“Although offer price is the first thing sellers look at, it is not the only thing. Terms are important. Often, someone else will offer more than you. If that’s the case, consider giving the seller favorable terms.
You can improve terms by using the seller’s escrow agent, reducing the inspection period, increasing the earnest money deposit, having a sooner closing date, and limiting appraisal and financing contingencies.”
-Lucas Machado, President, 
House Heroes LLC
16. Count on vacancies
“Unless you have deep pockets, you want to avoid the hole a vacancy creates in your cash flow. The only way to do this is to factor it into the cost of carrying the property. For most landlords, this means assuming that not all months in a year will produce an income.
For some that means 2% less in revenue, for others, it's as high as a 10% loss in revenue. The key is to assess the property, the type of tenant and then to factor in how much revenue loss you should expect on an annual basis.”
-Michael Jakobczak, Sales Representative, 
Zolo
17. As your portfolio grows, stop being a jack-of-all-trades
“Most of the time, new real estate investors convince themselves that they'll manage the property themselves. That's fine, as long as you have the time, energy and know-how. But as the number of rental units you own grows, you will probably need to outsource this task and this outsourcing comes at a cost.
To avoid any nasty surprises when buying a property, consider crunching the numbers to factor this cost in before you actually take on the cost. That way when you decide to 
hire a property manager
 the fee is already factored into your profit-and-loss calculations. In the meantime, remember that acting as your own property manager is an expense—so pay yourself.
This will help lower the tax owed on the revenue you earn, and it helps to remind you that your time is worth more than a freebie.”
-Michael Jakobczak, Sales Representative, 
Zolo

18. Know your tax laws
“Now more than ever, it’s crucial for real estate investors to be up-to-date with the new emerging tax laws. This means more than simply knowing what a Schedule E (Form 1040) is—it’s knowing how to file for the right deductions and taxes based on your state, county, and city.
For example, the new tax code allows residential property owners to deduct personal property costs (including furniture) and benefit from the reconfigured bonus depreciation rules.”
-Nate Masterson, Marketing Manager for 
Maple Holistics
19. Make your money when you buy 
“It's easy to overpay for real estate, especially in this market where things are selling quickly. In general, if you're keeping the property, don't count on appreciation as a way to make money. It can work but it's still a higher risk than buying right.
If you're buying a rental, look for homes that need a bit of work and have cash flow from day one. Don't forget to add in budgets for capital expenditures and routine maintenance.”
-Joe Horan, Owner of 
Wrightwood Homes
>>Tip:
 It's easy to evaluate and purchase cash-flowing rental properties on Roofstock.
20. Maintain contact during escrow to secure your deal
“The deal is not closed once you open escrow. If you are buying off market, the seller will likely have some level of anxiety over the deal and whether everything and everyone is legitimate without a real estate agent.
Have the escrow/title company reach out as soon as possible to introduce themselves and to let them know that they will be preparing the paperwork. This will provide 3rd party validation to the seller and put them at ease.
Also, set the expectation up front that you will be touching base periodically throughout the escrow period and be sure to do so."
-Jack Tangy,
Redbridge Properties
21. Have multiple exit strategies
“One should never buy a property without having multiple exit strategies. Take flipping for example. If you're just starting out or don't have a ton of extra capital, you want to mitigate your risk factors by buying properties that have good enough numbers to be a rental as well.
If you're buying flips and the market tanks, but the property would be even or negative cash flow when rented out then you're most likely going to lose tens of thousands of dollars.
Flipping starter homes that are in the price ranges that can be rented out for solid cash flow every month allows you to either build wealth by keeping them as rentals or mitigate your risks when things go sideways.”
-Shawn Breyer,
Breyer Home Buyers
22. Learn about market cycle theory
“Try to invest in the right phase of the cycle. This is not speculating, but trying to generally understand what will happen with the real estate prices in the following five years.
I've always purchased my investments during recession and early stages of recovery phases. This has enabled me to earn significant capital gains in addition to rent income.”
-Paul Koger, Head Trader and Founder,
Foxy Trades LLC
23. Find wholesalers and negotiate
“I flip $10M worth of real estate annually and have for over a decade now. My go-to move is to reach out to my
network
of wholesalers every time I need a new home. You can leverage social media to find groups of wholesalers to connect with.
Never accept the first offer from a wholesaler. Always ask for a lower price. They need to move homes fast, so offer to close quick for a discounted price.”

Hardcore Closer, LLC

Nerdy takeaways
There are ways to invest in real estate without owning physical property, including REITs and real estate platforms.
REITs are securities you purchase through a brokerage account, similar to investing in mutual funds.
Online real estate platforms connect investors to real estate projects.
Investing in real estate directly can be more lucrative, but it requires more time and often more cash flow.

Real Estate & Alternative Investments
Buying a property to rent out is one of the oldest ways of investing in real estate. But if you’ve ever had a landlord, you probably don't dream of being one: Fielding calls about oversize bugs and overflowing toilets doesn’t seem like the most glamorous job.
But done right, real estate investing can be lucrative, help diversify your existing investment portfolio and eventually provide a stream of
 passive income
. And many of the best real estate investments don’t require showing up at a tenant’s every beck and call.
Understandably, many investors don’t know where or how to invest in real estate. Here are some of the best ways to make money in real estate, ranging from low maintenance to high.

5 Ways to get started in real estate investing
1. Buy REITs (real estate investment trusts)
REITs allow you to invest in real estate
 without the physical real estate. Often compared to mutual funds, they're companies that own commercial real estate such as office buildings, retail spaces, apartments and hotels. REITs tend to pay
 high dividends
, making them a common retirement investment. Investors who don’t need or want regular income can automatically reinvest those dividends to grow their investment further.
Are REITs a good investment? They can be, but they can also be varied and complex. Some trade on an exchange like a stock, while others don’t. The type of REIT you purchase can be a big factor in the amount of risk you’re taking on, as non-traded REITs aren’t easily sold and might be hard to value. New investors should generally stick to publicly traded REITs, which you can purchase through
 brokerage firms
.
For that, you'll need a brokerage account. Opening a brokerage account takes less than 15 minutes, and many companies require no initial investment (though the REIT will likely have an investment minimum).
You can also gain exposure to a more diversified selection of real estate investments by buying into a fund with interests in many REITs. You could do this through a
 real estate ETF
 or by investing in a mutual fund with multiple REIT shares.

2. Use an online real estate investing platform
Real estate investment platforms connect developers to investors who want to finance projects through debt or equity. Investors hope to receive monthly or quarterly distributions in exchange for taking on significant risks and paying a fee to the platform. Like many real estate investments, these are speculative and illiquid — you can’t easily unload them the way you can trade a stock.
The rub is that you may need money to make money. Many of these platforms are open only to 
accredited investors
, defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as people who've earned income of more than $200,000 ($300,000 with a spouse) in each of the last two years or have a net worth of $1 million or more, not including a primary residence. Alternatives for those who can't meet that requirement include 
Fundrise
 and 
RealtyMogul

3. Think about investing in rental properties
Tiffany Alexy didn’t intend to become a real estate investor when she bought her first rental property at age 21. Then a college senior in Raleigh, North Carolina, she planned to attend grad school locally and figured buying would be better than renting.
“I went on Craigslist and found a four-bedroom, four-bathroom condo that was set up student-housing style. I bought it, lived in one bedroom and rented out the other three,” Alexy says.
The setup covered all of her expenses and brought in an extra $100 per month in cash — far from chump change for a grad student, and enough that Alexy caught the real estate bug.
Alexy entered the market using a strategy sometimes called house hacking, a term coined by BiggerPockets, an online resource for real estate investors. It essentially means you’re occupying your investment property either by renting out rooms, as Alexy did, or renting out units in a multi-unit building. David Meyer, vice president of data and analytics at the site, says house hacking lets investors buy a property with up to four units and still qualify for a residential loan.
Of course, you can also buy and rent out an entire investment property. Find one with combined expenses lower than the amount you can charge in rent. And if you don’t want to be the person who shows up with a toolbelt to fix a leak — or even the person who calls that person — you’ll also need to pay a property manager.
“If you manage it yourself, you’ll learn a lot about the industry, and if you buy future properties you’ll go into it with more experience,” says Meyer.

4. Consider flipping investment properties
This is HGTV come to life: You invest in an underpriced home in need of a little love, renovate it as inexpensively as possible and then resell it for a profit. Called
 house flipping
, the strategy is a wee bit harder than it looks on TV. It's also more expensive than it used to be, given the higher cost of building materials and mortgage interest rates. Many house flippers aim to pay for the homes in cash.
“There is a bigger element of risk, because so much of the math behind flipping requires a very accurate estimate of how much repairs are going to cost, which is not an easy thing to do,” says Meyer.
His suggestion: Find an experienced partner. “Maybe you have capital or time to contribute, but you find a contractor who is good at estimating expenses or managing the project,” he says.
The other risk of flipping is that the longer you hold the property, the less money you make because you may be paying a mortgage without bringing in any income. You can lower that risk by living in the house as you fix it up if the updates are cosmetic and you don’t mind a little dust.

5. Rent out a room
Finally, you could rent part of your home to dip the very edge of your toe in the real estate waters. Such an arrangement can substantially decrease housing costs, allowing people to stay in their homes as they continue to benefit from price appreciation on their property.
Adding roommates can also make a mortgage payment more attainable for younger people. But if you're not sure you're ready, you could try a site like Airbnb. It’s house hacking for the commitment-phobe: You don’t have to take on a long-term tenant, Airbnb at least somewhat prescreens potential renters, and the company’s host guarantee protects against damages.
Renting out a room feels a lot more accessible than the fancy concept of real estate investing. If you've got a spare room, you can rent it.
Like all investment decisions, the best real estate investments are the ones that best serve you, the investor. Think about how much time you have, how much capital you're willing to invest and whether you want to be the one who deals with household issues when they inevitably come up. If you don't have DIY skills, consider investing in real estate through a REIT or a crowdfunding platform rather than directly in a property.

 When looking for investment options, there are many choices for where to put your money. Stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, and real estate are all good investments no matter what level of experience you have; forex or cryptocurrency may be too volatile for beginning investors. Which option you choose will depend on how involved you want to be in your investment, how much money you have to start investing, and how much risk you are comfortable taking on.
 Buying and owning real estate is an 
investment strategy
 that can be both satisfying and lucrative. Unlike stock and bond investors, prospective real estate owners can use 
leverage
 to buy a property by paying a portion of the total cost upfront, then paying off the balance, plus 
interest
, over time.
 What makes a good real estate investment? A good investment has a high chance of success, or return on your investment. If your investment involves a high level of risk, that risk should be balanced out by a high possible reward. Even if you choose investments with a high probability of success, though, that isn't a guarantee. You shouldn't put money into real estate—or any other investment—if you cannot afford to lose that money.
 Though a traditional 
mortgage
 generally requires a 20% to 25% down payment, in some cases, a 5% down payment is all it takes to purchase an entire property. This ability to control the asset the moment papers are signed emboldens both real estate 
flippers
 and landlords, who can, in turn, take out second mortgages on their homes in order to make down payments on additional properties. Here are five key ways investors can make money on real estate.
Key Takeaways
Aspiring real estate owners can buy a property by using leverage, paying a portion of its total cost upfront, and paying off the balance over time.
One of the primary ways in which investors can make money in real estate is to become the landlord of a rental property.
People who are flippers, buying up undervalued real estate, fixing it up, and selling it, can also earn income.
Real estate investment groups are a more hands-off way to make money in real estate.
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are basically dividend-paying stocks.
 1. Rental Properties 
 Owning 
rental properties
 can be a great opportunity for individuals who have do-it-yourself (DIY) renovation skills and the patience to manage tenants. Properties can be local, or there may be 
good out-of-state opportunities
. This investing strategy does require substantial capital to finance upfront maintenance costs and to cover periods when the property is empty or when tenants do not pay their rent.
Pros
Provides regular income and properties can appreciate
Maximizes capital through leverage
Many tax-deductible associated expenses
Cons
Managing tenants can be tedious
Potentially damage property from tenants
Reduced income from potential vacancies
 According to U.S. Census Bureau data, the sales prices of new homes (a rough indicator for real estate values) consistently increased in value from the 1960s to 2007, before dipping during the financial crisis.
 Subsequently, sales prices resumed their ascent, even surpassing pre-crisis levels.
 The long-term effects of the coronavirus pandemic on real estate values remain to be seen.
Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. 
If you think you've been discriminated against
 based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take. One such step is to file a report to the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
 or with the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
.
 2. Real Estate Investment Groups (REIGs) 
Real estate investment groups (REIGs)
 are ideal for people who want to own rental real estate without the hassles of running it. Investing in REIGs requires a capital cushion and access to financing.
 REIGs are like small 
mutual funds
 that invest in rental properties.
 In a typical real estate investment group, a company buys or builds a set of apartment blocks or condos, then allows investors to purchase them through the company, thereby joining the group.
 A single investor can own one or multiple units of self-contained living space, but the company operating the investment group collectively manages all of the units, handling maintenance, advertising vacancies, and interviewing tenants. In exchange for conducting these management tasks, the company takes a percentage of the monthly rent.

 is in the investor’s name, and all of the units pool a portion of the rent to guard against vacancies. To this end, you'll receive some income even if your unit is empty. As long as the vacancy rate for the pooled units doesn’t spike too high, there should be enough to cover costs.
Pros
More hands-off than owning rentals
Provides income and appreciation
Cons
Vacancy risks
Fees similar to those associated with mutual funds
Susceptible to unscrupulous managers
 3. House Flipping 
 House flipping is for people with significant experience in real estate valuation, marketing, and renovation. House flipping requires capital and the ability to do, or oversee, repairs as needed.
 This is the proverbial "wild side" of 
real estate investing
. Just as 
day trading
 is different from 
buy-and-hold 
investing, real estate flippers are distinct from buy-and-rent landlords. Case in point—real estate flippers often look to profitably sell the undervalued properties they buy in less than six months.
 Pure property flippers often don't invest in improving properties. Therefore, the investment must already have the 
intrinsic value
 needed to turn a profit without any alterations, or they'll eliminate the property from contention.
 Flippers who are unable to swiftly unload a property may find themselves in trouble because they typically don’t keep enough uncommitted cash on hand to pay the mortgage on a property over the long term. This can lead to continued, snowballing losses.
 There is another kind of flipper who makes money by buying reasonably priced properties and adding value by renovating them. This can be a longer-term investment, and investors may only be able to take on one or two properties at a time.
Pros
Ties up capital for a shorter time period
Can offer significant returns
Cons
Requires a deeper market knowledge
Hot markets cooling unexpectedly
 4. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) 
 A 
real estate investment trust (REIT)
 is best for investors who want portfolio exposure to real estate without a traditional real estate transaction.
 A REIT is created when a corporation (or trust) uses investors’ money to purchase and operate income properties. REITs are bought and sold on the major exchanges, like any other stock.
 A corporation must payout 90% of its taxable profits in the form of dividends in order to maintain its REIT status. By doing this, REITs avoid paying corporate income tax, whereas a regular company would be taxed on its profits and then have to decide whether or not to distribute its after-tax profits as dividends.
 Like regular dividend-paying stocks, REITs are a solid investment for stock market investors who desire regular income. In comparison to the aforementioned types of real estate investment, REITs afford investors entry into nonresidential investments, such as malls or office buildings, that are generally not feasible for individual investors to purchase directly.
 More importantly, REITs are highly liquid because they are exchange-traded trusts. In other words, you won’t need a real estate agent and a title transfer to help you cash out your investment. In practice, REITs are a more formalized version of a real estate investment group.
 Finally, when looking at REITs, investors should distinguish between 
equity REITs
 that own buildings and mortgage REITs that provide financing for real estate and may also invest in 
mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
. Both offer exposure to real estate, but the nature of the exposure is different. An equity REIT is more traditional in that it represents ownership in real estate, whereas the mortgage REITs focus on the income from real estate mortgage financing.
Pros
Essentially dividend-paying stocks
Core holdings tend to be long-term, cash-producing assets
Cons
Leverage associated with traditional rental real estate does not apply
 5. Online Real Estate Platforms 
 Real estate investing platforms are for those who want to join others in investing in a bigger commercial or residential deal. The investment is made via online real estate platforms, which are also known as 
real estate crowdfunding
. This still requires investing capital, although less than what's required to purchase properties outright.
 The 
best real estate crowdfunding platforms
 can pool resources of investors looking for investment opportunities with other investors looking for financial backing for new or current real estate projects. Thereby giving you the opportunity of diversifying your investments with not much money.
Pros
Can invest in single projects or portfolio of projects
Geographic diversification
Cons
Tend to be illiquid with lockup periods
Management fees
Why Should I Add Real Estate to My Portfolio?
Real estate is a distinct asset class that many experts agree should be a part of a well-diversified portfolio. This is because real estate does not usually closely correlate with stocks, bonds, or commodities. Real estate investments can also produce income from rents or mortgage payments in addition to the potential for capital gains.
What Is Direct vs. Indirect Real Estate Investing?
Direct real estate investments involve actually owning and managing properties. Indirect real estate involves investing in pooled vehicles that own and manage properties, such as REITs or real estate crowdfunding.
Is Real Estate Crowdfunding Risky?
Compared to other forms of real estate investing, crowdfunding can be somewhat riskier. This is often because crowdfunding for real estate is relatively new. Moreover, some of the projects available may appear on crowdfunding sites because they were unable to source financing from more traditional means. Finally, many real estate crowdfunding platforms require investors' money to be locked up for a period of several years, making it somewhat illiquid. Still, the top platforms 
boast annualized returns
 of between 2% and 20%, according to Investopedia research.
 The Bottom Line 
 Whether real estate investors use their properties to generate rental income or to bide their time until the perfect selling opportunity arises, it's possible to build out a robust investment program by paying a relatively small part of a property's total value upfront. And as with any investment, there is profit and risk with real estate investing and markets can go up as well as down.

Real estate is often a rewarding investment, with the potential for 
passive income
 and long-term appreciation. It can also be a smart way to diversify your portfolio beyond the traditional lineup of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.
While a home might be your first foray into real estate investing, there are numerous other avenues for tapping the market, from rental properties and house flipping to real estate investment trusts (REITs) and online real estate platforms. Here are six investments to consider to diversify your portfolio with real estate.Â 
Buy a rental property
Buying and leasing out a rental property to short- or long-term tenants is a classic way to invest in real estate. A huge perk of being a landlord is that 
you can deduct many of the costs
 associated with the property, including maintenance, repairs, insurance premiums, utilities, administrative fees, mortgage interest, and depreciation.Â 
Of course, the downside is that rental property can be a time-consuming investment with high start-up costs, You might have to deal with late payments, property damage, and unruly tenants. Still, you can enjoy positive cash flow and long-term appreciation with the right property. Whatâs more, if you sell the home and swap it for a âlike-kindâ property, you can use a 
1031 exchange
 to defer capital gains taxes.Â 
Rent out a room
House hacking can be an excellent way to dabble in real estate investing. The strategy involves renting out part of the home you live in, such as a single room, the basement, an attic, or an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). The start-up costs can be minimal, depending on the condition of the space. And the extra income can help offset your monthly housing expenses while you pay down the mortgage and build equity.Â 
Â A more advanced house hack is to invest in a multifamily property: living in one unit and renting out the rest. Whether renting out a room or half of a duplex, you can find long-term tenants orâwhere permittedâopen the space to short-term rentals using an online platform such as 
Airbnb
.Â 
Use an online real estate investing platform
Online real estate investing platforms (aka âcrowdfunding websitesâ) are the new kids on the block in the real estate investment world. These platforms match developers with interested investors who pool their capital to fund real estate projects with as little as $500. In exchange, investors get debt or equity in a project, as well as monthly or quarterly distributions if all goes well. While these investments offer higher potential returns than publicly traded REITs, they carry more risk and are generally illiquid, so you may not be able to sell your shares quickly.Â 
Some platforms are open only to 
accredited investors
, while others, including 
RealtyMogul
, offer opportunities for accredited and nonaccredited investors alike. Investors typically pay an annual management fee ranging from about 
0.25% to 2.50%
 (depending on the platform), and other fees may apply.Â 
Flip a house
House flipping involves buying a discounted property, fixing it up, and selling it for a profit. With the right property you can turn a quicker profit than from managing a property, but itâs not as easy as it looks on TV. To be a successful flipper, you need to see a propertyâs potential and have a vision for bringing it to life. You also need sufficient cash, a reliable team of contractors, and accurate cost-estimating skills to ensure that you earn a profit.Â 
Strong project organization skills are also a plus. The sooner you can sell the property, the less youâll spend on holding costs, including mortgage payments, utilities, property taxes, homeownersâ association (HOA) fees, and insurance.Â 
Buy a REIT
A REIT can be an excellent option if you want exposure to real estate without the responsibility and headaches of managing rentals. A REIT is a company that owns and operates income-generating properties, such as apartment buildings, offices, warehouses, medical facilities, hotels, and retail centers. Like mutual funds, a REIT pools the capital of multiple investors and owns a portfolio of assets. Investors buy shares of the REIT and earn a proportionate share of the income.Â 
A key selling point is that most REITs are publicly traded on stock exchanges, making them an easy and highly liquid way to gain exposure to real estate. A REIT makes money leasing space and collecting rent on its real estate holdings. In turn, investors earn money through dividends. By law, 
REITs must pay out at least 90%
 of their taxable income as shareholder dividends each year.Â 
Invest in a real estate investment group (REIG)
A 
real estate investment group (REIG)
 is a club of private investors who pool their money and expertise to buy income-generating properties. They can be a good option if you want to own rental properties but donât want sole responsibility for managing them. REIGs leverage the buying power (and experience) of the entire group to invest in various types of properties, including apartment blocks, condominiums, and commercial buildings.Â 
On the plus side, REIGs allow you to learn from other, more experienced real estate investors while participating in deals that can expand your wheelhouse. However, the downside is that membership fees could erode your profits, and the investment could flop if you partner with an inexperienced or unskilled group. Still, if you do your research and find a group that aligns with your goals and risk tolerance, a REIG could be a worthwhile venture.Â 
Time Stamp: Investing in real estate has plenty of potential
Real estate investments can offer numerous benefits, including stable cash flow, long-term appreciation, portfolio diversification, tax breaks, and the ability to leverage your funds. Of course, there are also drawbacksâamong them lack of liquidity, high start-up costs, and the reality that real estate investing can be a long grind.Â 
Still, itâs helpful to remember that there are multiple ways to invest in real estate, and some options might be a better fit than others. For example, rental property might be a good option if youâre looking for an investment that offers hands-on control and money-saving tax breaks. You might opt for a REIT if you prefer a hands-off approach and a more liquid asset. If you want the best of both worlds, you might invest in rental properties and REITs. After all, you donât have to pick just one type of investment.
Ultimately, investing in real estate depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Working with a financial advisor and researching your options can help you find an investment that works for you.Â 
Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
How much do real estate investors make?
Thereâs no limit to how much a real estate investor can earn. For example, Donald Bren, the founder of the Irvine Company, has reportedly amassed a $15.5 billion fortune investing in commercial real estate. Of course, most real estate investors donât enjoy this level of success.Â 
If you invest in equity REITs, you might expect a total annual return of about 6% to 11%, based on their performance over the past 50 years, according to 
data from Nareit
 (the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts). The YTD return as of July 31 was 5.03%.Â 
You can also get a job in the field. According to 
ZipRecruiter
, the average salary for real estate investors is $139,851 per year. Ultimately, your earnings potential depends your location, the investment(s) you choose, the number of deals you make, your time commitment, your risk tolerance, how well capitalized you are, and sometimes a little luck.Â 
What are the pros and cons of investing in real estate?
Like all investments, real estate investing has pros and cons to consider. On the plus side, real estate investments can offer portfolio diversification, passive cash flow, long-term appreciation, and tax advantages, including deductions, depreciation, and tax-deferred capital gains. On the negative side, real estate investing can be time-consuming, property values can decline, the income can be variable, and it can be difficult to sell quickly.Â 
Of course, different types of real estate investments come with various risks and rewards. Do your homework before deciding whether a particular investment makes sense for your goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.Â 
What are the top tax benefits of real estate investing?
The tax treatment of real estate investments varies, depending on how you invest.
Rental property ownership comes with the most tax breaks. For example, 
you may be able to deduct
:
Mortgage interest.Â 
Property taxes and occupancy taxes.
Insurance premiums.
Maintenance and repairs (improvements must be depreciated).
Utilities.
Advertising.
Legal and professional fees.
Travel costs related to managing the property.
Home office expenses.
Depreciation.
Wages and salaries
 for employees and independent contractors.
Losses not covered by insurance.
Deferred capital gains taxes (through 1031 exchanges).
Up to 
20% of your net rental income
 (this deduction is scheduled to last through 2025).
The same rules apply when you rent out a room in your house, but you can only deduct expenses related to the actual rented space, not the entire home (similar to how the home office deduction works). For example, if you have a 1,200-square-foot house and rent out a room thatâs 300 square feet, you can deduct 25% (300 Ã· 1,200) of your home expenses.
The tax treatment of house-flipping is complicated and hinges on whether the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers you an investor or dealer (working with an advisor is recommended). Forming a limited liability company (LLC) may allow you to deduct certain house-flipping expenses, including home improvement costs on sold properties, property taxes, and building permits. However, the costs of capital improvements 
generally arenât deductible
. Instead, theyâre usually added to the propertyâs basis, which can help lower your capital gains burden when you sell.Â 
Other types of real estate investments donât offer the same tax breaks as rental property, but you still owe taxes on income, dividends, and capital gains. A financial advisor or tax specialist can optimize your tax strategy to make the most of your real estate investments.

Real estate investment has long been a proven avenue for wealth creation, and with the proper knowledge and approach, it can offer tremendous opportunities for beginners. Whether considering your first investment property or seeking to expand your portfolio, understanding the essentials is crucial to successfully navigating the dynamic real estate market. In this article, we'll summarize the key insights from my blog post "10 Essential Tips for Beginner Real Estate Investors" to provide a concise overview of the fundamental principles you need to know.
1. Start with a Clear Investment Strategy:
Having a solid foundation is critical in any venture, and real estate investment is no exception. Define your investment goals, assess your risk tolerance, and develop a clear strategy that aligns with your objectives. Are you interested in residential or commercial properties? Long-term rentals or short-term flips? Having a well-defined plan will help guide your decisions and ensure you stay focused on your goals.
2. Research Local Real Estate Markets:
Real estate markets vary significantly from one location to another. Thoroughly researching local market trends, including property values, rental rates, and vacancy rates, is vital. By understanding the dynamics of your target market, you can identify areas with growth potential and make informed investment choices that maximize returns.
3. Analyze Investment Potential:
Conducting a comprehensive financial analysis is critical before making any real estate investment. Evaluate potential cash flow, return on investment (ROI), and other key financial metrics. This analysis should include property taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, and potential rental income. A detailed assessment will help determine whether a property is worthwhile.
4. Build a Reliable Network:
Networking is critical. You must build a network with real estate agents, property managers, lenders, and fellow investors. Attend industry events, join online communities, and engage in conversations to expand your network. Collaborating with experienced individuals can provide valuable insights, opportunities for partnerships, and access to off-market deals.
5. Secure Adequate Financing:
Understanding your financing options is crucial for successful real estate investing—research different financing avenues, such as traditional mortgages, 
private lenders
, or partnerships. Calculate your budget and assess your borrowing capacity to determine the most suitable financing method for your investment plans. Building a solid credit profile will also enhance your eligibility for favorable loan terms.
6. Perform Due Diligence:
Before finalizing any real estate transaction:
Perform thorough due diligence.
Conduct property inspections, review relevant documents, and verify all financial details.
Engage professionals such as real estate attorneys and inspectors to identify any potential risks or red flags.
Being diligent in your research will minimize unforeseen issues and protect your investment.
7. Mitigate Risk with Diversification:
Diversification is a prudent strategy for reducing risk in real estate investing. Instead of investing all your capital in a single property, consider spreading your investments across different property types, locations, or strategies. Diversification helps protect your portfolio against market volatility and potential losses.
8. Stay Informed and Adapt:
The real estate market is constantly changing. Stay informed about industry trends, regulatory changes, and economic factors that impact the market. Continuously educate yourself through books, podcasts, courses, and networking events. Being adaptable and proactive will help you make better decisions and take advantage of new opportunities.
9. Leverage Technology and Data:
Technology and data play a significant role in real estate investing in today's digital age. Utilize online platforms, data analytics, and real estate investment software to streamline your research, analysis, and property management processes. These tools can provide valuable insights, automate repetitive tasks, and improve efficiency in your investment operations.
10. Learn from Mistakes
Mistakes are inevitable in any learning process, and real estate investing is no exception. Embrace your mistakes as valuable lessons and opportunities for growth. Reflect on your experiences, analyze what went wrong, and adjust your strategies accordingly. Surround yourself with experienced mentors who can share their lessons learned, providing guidance and support along your investment journey.
Conclusion:
Real estate investment can be rewarding but requires careful planning, research, and adaptability. By following these ten essential tips, beginner real estate investors can lay a strong foundation for success. Remember to define your investment strategy, conduct thorough market research, analyze potential investments, build a reliable network, secure appropriate financing, perform due diligence, diversify your portfolio, stay informed, leverage technology and data, and learn from your mistakes. With these insights, you can confidently navigate the dynamic real estate market and unlock lucrative opportunities.
